            Political law is defined as the branch of public law which deals with the organization and operation of the governmental organs of the State and defines the relations of the state with the inhabitants of its territory. (Macariola v. Asuncion, A.M. No. 133-J, May 31, 1982) 
            """,
            """<b>The Constitution</b>
            It is a written and codified document which serves as the fundamental law of the state. A written instrument enacted by direct action of the people by which the fundamental powers of the government are established, limited, and defined, and by which those powers are distributed among the several departments for their safe and useful exercise for the benefit of the people. (Manila Prince Hotel v. GSIS, G.R. No. 122156, February 3, 1997) 

            The constitution is the work or will of the people themselves, in their original, sovereign, and unlimited capacity. Law is the work or will of the legislature in its derivative and subordinate capacity. The one is the work of the creator, and the other of the creature. The constitution fixes limits to the exercise of legislative authority and prescribes the orbit within which it must move. In short, gentlemen, the constitution is the sun of the political system, around which all Legislative, Executive, and Judicial bodies must revolve. Whatever may be the case in other countries, yet in this, there can be no doubt, that every act of the legislature, repugnant to the Constitution, is absolutely void. (Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 308, April 1, 1795)

            """<b>The Importance of the Constitution</b>
            The role of the constitution cannot be overlooked. It is through the constitution that the fundamental powers of government are established, limited, and defined, and by which these powers are distributed among the several departments. The constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must conform and to which all persons, including the highest officials of the land, must defer. Constitutional doctrines must remain steadfast no matter what may be the tides of time. It cannot be simply made to sway and accommodate the call of situations and much more tailor itself to the whims and caprices of government and the people who run it. (Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission, G.R. No. 192935, December 7, 2010)

            The constitution, as the fundamental law of the land, deserves the utmost respect and obedience of all the citizens of this nation. No one can trivialize the constitution by cavalierly amending or revising it in blatant violation of the clearly specified modes of amendment and revision laid down in the constitution itself.

            """<b>A Constitution Is a System of Fundamental Laws</b>
             A constitution is a system of fundamental laws for the governance and administration of a nation. It is supreme, imperious, absolute, and unalterable except by the authority from which it emanates. It has been defined as the fundamental and paramount law of the nation. It prescribes the permanent framework of a system of government, assigns to the different departments their respective powers and duties, and establishes certain fixed principles on which government is founded. The fundamental conception in other words is that it is a supreme law to which all other laws must conform and in accordance with which all private rights must be determined and all public authority administered.

             There are several types of constitution: 
             1. <b>Written constitution</b> is a kind of a constitution whose provisions are all contained in a single document. A good example of this constitution is the Philippine Constitution.
             2. <b>Unwritten constitution</b> is a kind of constitution where the provisions are not contained in a single document but rather in different documents which are considered as part of the fundamental law of the land. A more appropriate term for this kind would be un- compiled constitution. The constitution of United Kingdom is a fine example of this type of constitution.
             3. <b>Conventional or enacted constitution</b> is a type of constitution that was formulated by a constitutional convention that is called to draft the constitution.
             4. <b>Cumulative or evolved constitution</b> is a constitution which is not drafted by a positive act of the state, but it developed as a part of the history of the nation.
             5. <b>Rigid or inelastic constitution</b> is one which cannot be easily amended unless such amendment is provided for by the constitution itself.
             6. <b>Flexible or elastic constitution</b> is one which can easily be changed anytime.

            1. <b>Constitution of Government</b>  which refers to those provisions which set up the governmental structure specifically, Articles VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X of the 1987 Constitution,
            2. <b>Constitution of Liberty</b>  are the provisions which guarantee individual fundamental liberties against governmental abuse specifically provided in Articles III, IV, V, XII, XIII, XIV, and XV of the 1987 Constitution, and
            3. <b>Constitution of Sovereignty</b>  which refers to those provisions which outline the process whereby the sovereign people may change the constitution. These are provided in Article XVII and Article II, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution.

            """<b> Qualities of a Written Constitution</b>
             A desirable written constitution must be broad, brief, and definite.

            It must be broad in the sense that it provides for the organization and structure of the entire government. It must embody the political history of the nation, the present realities and the future prospects of the nation's destiny. The constitution must be brief for it must limit itself to the basic principles and leave the implementations of such fundamental principles to the sound judgment of the legislative department. It must be definite in order to avoid unnecessary ambiguities which would later on lead to confusion, brought about by the different interpretations and constructions of its provisions. (Cruz, 2003)

             Under the doctrine of Constitutional Supremacy, if a law or contract violates any norm of the constitution, that law or contract whether promulgated by the legislative or by the executive branch or entered into by private persons for private purposes is null and void and without any force and effect. Thus, since the constitution is the fundamental, paramount and supreme law of the nation, it is deemed written in every statute and contract. (Manila Prince Hotel v.

             In case of doubt, the constitution should be considered self- executing rather than non-self-executing. Unless the contrary is clearly intended, the provisions of the constitution should be considered self-executing, as a contrary rule would give the legislature discretion to determine when, or whether, they shall be effective. These provisions would be subordinated to the will of the lawmaking body, which could make them entirely meaningless by simply refusing to pass the needed implementing statute.

            Based on the decrees of June 18 and 23, 1898, Aguinaldo convened the Revolutionary Congress at Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan. The delegates were elected by the people but in areas which were still under the Spanish control, Aguinaldo appointed their delegates to Congress. The members composing the Congress included 43 lawyers, 18 doctors, five pharmacists, seven businessmen, four agriculturists, three educators, three soldiers, two engineers, two painters, and one priest. (Constantino, 1975)

             The Malolos Constitution is the first important Filipino document produced by the people's representatives although not all the members who drafted and approved the Constitution were elected by the people. The Constitution was anchored on democratic traditions although it was based and patterned on the constitutions of other countries. The Malolos Constitution created a state whose government was republican in character - popular and representative democracy composed of three distinct branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The Constitution specifically provided for safeguards against abuses and enumerated the national and individual rights not only of the Filipinos and of the aliens in the country as well. 

             The legislative powers were exercised by the Assembly of Representatives composed of delegates elected according to law. To make the function of Congress continuous, the document provided for a Permanent Commission which would sit as a law-making body when Congress was not in session - a result of the insecurities of the illustrado members of congress that the president might abuse his powers while the assembly is not in session. The assembly elected the President of the Republic. The Cabinet, composed of the Secretaries of the different Departments of the government, was responsible not to the President, but to the Assembly. The administration of justice was vested in the Supreme Court and in inferior courts to be established according to law. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was to be elected by the Assembly with the concurrence of the President and the Cabinet. (Agoncillo, 1990)

            Based on the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Law, a constitution must be drafted by a Constitutional Convention and ratified by the Filipino people prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Government. On July 10, 1934, the Filipinos elected 202 delegates to the Constitutional Convention. On July 30, 1934, the Convention was formally inaugurated with Claro M. Recto as president.

             The draft of the Constitution was approved with amendments on January 31, 1935. It was written in English and in Spanish. On February 8, 1935, the Convention approved the Constitution by a vote of 177 in favor and one against. The lone delegate who voted against the approval of the Constitution was Tomas Cabili of Lanao.

              The Constitution was brought to Washington by Quezon, Recto, and Roxas for the approval of the President of the United States in accordance with the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Law. President Franklin Roosevelt approved the Charter on March 23, 1935. The Constitution was submitted to the Filipino people for ratification on a plebiscite held on May 14, 1935. The Filipinos approved the Constitution by a vote of 1,213,046 and only 44,963 voted against the Constitution.

               For the first time in Philippine history, the women voted in the plebiscite to ratify the 1935 Constitution. The 1935 Constitution provided that women suffrage or the right to vote would be granted if no less than 300,000 qualified women were to vote affirmatively for the grant of the right of suffrage within two years after the adoption of the Constitution. It divided the government into three co-equal branches namely the legislative, executive, and judicial. The executive power was vested on the President of the Philippines who would be elected directly by the people to serve for a term of four years and can be reelected for another four-year term. The legislative power was vested in the Congress of the Philippines composed of the Senate with twenty-four senators elected at large for a term of six years and the House of Representatives composed of not more than 120 members representing the different provinces of the country with a term of four years.

             On January 23, 1942, General Masaharu Homma, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Imperial Army in the Central Philippines renamed the national government as Administrative Organization. He also issued an order to Jorge Vargas, who was then an acting mayor of Manila and appointed him Chairman of the newly created Executive Commission. All the Commissioners reported directly to the Chairman of the Executive Commission. Then on January 29, 1942, the Council of the State was created as an advisory body to the Chairman of the Executive Commission. The Japanese military authorities saw the difficulty of gaining the trust and cooperation of the people with the present setup of the national government. As such, they deemed it necessary to grant Philippine independence soon as part of their propaganda efforts in gaining Filipino support and cooperation.

             On June 18, 1943, the KALIBAPI was tasked to form the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence. Two days later, the Commission was organized with Jose Laurel as president and Benigno Aquino and Ramon Avancena as vice presidents. The Commission drafted a Constitution which was ratified on September 4, 1943 according to the rules set by the Japanese military authorities.

               The Constitution provided for Assembly. On September 20, 1943, delegates to the legislature were elected. On September 25, 1943, the Legislature elected Jose Laurel as President of the Republic of the Philippines that will soon be established as provided by the Constitution. On October 14, 1943, the second Philippine Republic which is known in history as the puppet republic was inaugurated, and Jose P. Laurel was sworn to power as president. 

		  However, this Constitution was short-lived owing to the fact that it was only made effective following the dictates of the Japanese invaders. Thus, after the liberation of the Philippines and the restoration of the Commonwealth government, the 1943 Constitution became a mere scrap of paper in the eyes of the Filipinos.

		     After the declaration of martial law, Marcos reconvened the 1971 Constitutional Convention to continue their task of framing a new charter. On November 29, 1972, the final draft was finished and was presented to Marcos on December 1, 1972. Marcos scheduled a plebiscite to ratify the Constitution on January 15 to 17, 1973.

		     Marcos and his cohorts convened the barangay assemblies and called the voters in every barangay including the youth. The people in the assembly supposedly voted to ratify the Constitution which was a handiwork of Marcos. Based on the record released by Malacañang, 95 percent of those present approved the new charter. On this basis, Marcos signed the Constitution and declared its ratification on January 17, 1973. 

		     The legal luminaries of the country opposed to Marcos assailed the validity of the 1973 Constitution especially the manner it was ratified. However, the Supreme Court which at that time beholden to Marcos, instead of upholding the majesty of the law and equity ruled on January 22, 1973 that the question of legality was moot and academic. This controversial decision of the highest tribunal led to the resignation of Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion.

		     The 1973 Constitution established a parliamentary form of government with the prime minister as the chief executive. The legislative power was vested in the unicameral national assembly. The right of suffrage was made compulsory to all qualified voters. The Constitution also abolished the parity rights provisions of the 1935 Constitution, thus allowing only the Filipino citizens to own real property and exploit the natural resources of the country.

             The 1973 charter had undergone several amendments to suit the desires and whims of the Marcos government. In 1976, an amendment was made which created the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP) with more than 120 members including Marcos. Marcos was also empowered to appoint sectoral representatives and his cabinet members to the Batasang Pambansa. Marcos assumed the powers of both the president and the prime minister. Another amendment, known as the sixth amendment, empowered Marcos to make laws in cases of grave national emergency and these laws shall form part of the laws of the land.

             These amendments were submitted to the people in a plebiscite on October 16-17, 1976. As expected, more than 90 percent of the people ratified the amendments based on the data released by Malacañang and as reported by the Marcos controlled media.

             On January 30, 1980, another plebiscite was conducted to ratify the amendment which extended the retirement age of the justices of the Supreme Court from 65 to 70 years old, purportedly to bar the liberal and progressive justices from becoming Chief Justices.

            The State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a definite territory; (c) a government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other states. (Article I, 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of the State)

		   <b> Doctrine of "Acts of State" </b>
		   The Acts of State Doctrine provides that every state is bound to respect the independence of every other state and the courts will not sit in judgment of another government's acts done within its own territory. (Twomey, 2011) 

            A further restriction of any national jurisdiction consists in the principle that no state has jurisdiction over another state. This principle has been known for ages as the maxim par in parem non habet imperium (Latin which means equals do not have authority over one another). It is based upon the mutual independence of sovereigns and the fact resulting therefrom, that no state in its capacity as a subject of international law can be subject to the laws of another state. This also means that acts carried out by a state in the exercise of its sovereign powers are exempted from the jurisdiction of other states by virtue of their very nature. Thus, foreign states are exempted from municipal jurisdiction of another state. The immunity granted to foreign states in the municipal courts of foreign states extends to the representatives of the said sovereign.

There is no required number of people that would constitute as an element of the state. There is also no requirement for the population to be indigenous and the extent of social and cultural cohesion required is also unclear. In reality, most of the population of a state will be its 'nationals' and have a right to reside in that state. The criteria of qualification for nationality are determined by national law.

            Generally, the people comprising the state are referred to as citizens. Citizens are entitled to the rights and privileges of a freeman. Citizens are either natural born or naturalized and they owe allegiance to a government, and are entitled to protection from it. 

            Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law of a state that bestows on that person the rights and privileges of membership in a political community. Such rights and privileges include the right to vote, work and live in the country and the right to return to the country, besides other rights. A citizen may also be subject to certain duties, such as the duty to serve in the army. A person may have multiple citizenships and a person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless. On the other hand, subjects are people of a monarchial state and governed by the monarch's law.

            Nationality is membership in a political community with corresponding rights and obligations. In exchange for the protection that the national gets from the state, he is required to obey its laws. This term is interchangeably used with the term citizenship. However, citizenship has a more exclusive scope and applies only to certain members of the state who are accorded more privileges than the rest of the people who owe the state their allegiance. For example, during the American colonization of the Philippines, Filipinos and Americans were considered nationals of the United States of America but Filipinos were not entitled to American citizenship rights like the right to vote for the public officers of the United States.

            It refers to the portion of the earth that is under the effective control of the state, and which demarcates the state from its neighbors. The size of the territory of states can vary widely from Russia with 17 million square kilometers to the principality of Monaco with just two square kilometers territory. The borders of the state's territory need to be reasonably determinate. The territory of the state sometimes is defined by a treaty or mandated by its constitution. Territorial disputes with neighboring states would not normally affect the state's status in international law.

             Territory is a geographical area that is owned and controlled by the state in order to exercise its sovereignty. The territory of the state must be permanent and with well-defined boundaries.

      Colt Republic Act No. 9522 is not unconstitutional. It is a Statutory Tool to Demarcate the Country's Maritime Zones and Continental Shelf under UNCLOS III, not to Delineate Philippine Territory.

      UNCLOS III has nothing to do with the acquisition (or loss) of territory. It is a multilateral treaty regulating, among others, sea-use rights over maritime zones (i.e., the territorial waters [12 nautical miles from the baselines], contiguous zone [24 nautical miles from the baselines], exclusive economic zone [200 nautical miles from the baselines]), and continental shelves that UNCLOS III delimits. UNCLOS III was the culmination of decades-long negotiations among United Nations members to codify norms regulating the conduct of States in the world's oceans and submarine areas, recognizing coastal and archipelagic States' graduated  authority over a limited span of waters and submarine lands along their coasts.

      On the other hand, baselines laws such as Republic Act No. 9522 are enacted by UNCLOS III State parties to mark out specific base points along their coasts from which baselines are drawn, either straight or contoured, to serve as geographic starting points to measure the breadth of the maritime zones and continental shelf.

      Thus, baselines laws are nothing but statutory mechanisms for UNCLOS III States parties to delimit with precision the extent of their maritime zones and continental shelves. In turn, this gives notice to the rest of the international community of the scope of the maritime space and submarine areas within which State parties exercise treaty-based rights, namely, the exercise of sovereignty over territorial waters (Article 2), the jurisdiction to enforce customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitation laws in the contiguous zone (Article 33), and the right to exploit the living and non-living resources in the exclusive economic zone (Article 56) and continental shelf (Article 77).

      Even under petitioners' theory that the Philippine territory embraces the islands and all the waters within the rectangular area delimited in the Treaty of Paris, the baselines of the Philippines would still have to be drawn in accordance with Republic Act No. 9522 because this is the only way to draw the baselines in conformity with UNCLOS III. The baselines cannot be drawn from the boundaries or other portions of the rectangular area delineated in the Treaty of Paris, but from the "outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago."

      UNCLOS III and its ancillary baselines laws play no role in the acquisition, enlargement, or, as petitioners claim, diminution of territory. Under traditional international law typology, States acquire (or conversely, lose) territory through occupation, accretion, cession, and prescription, not by executing multilateral treaties on the regulations of sea-use rights or enacting statutes to comply with the treaty's terms to delimit maritime zones and continental shelves. Territorial  claims to land features are outside UNCLOS III and are instead governed by the rules on general international law.

      Had Congress in Republic Act No. 9522 enclosed the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal as part of the Philippine archipelago, adverse legal effects would have ensued. The Philippines would have committed a breach of two provisions of UNCLOS III. First, Article 47(3) of UNCLOS III requires that "the drawing of such baselines shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago." Second, Article 47(2) of UNCLOS III requires that "the length of the baselines shall not exceed 100 nautical miles," save for three percent (3%) of the total number of baselines which can reach up to 125 nautical miles.

      Although the Philippines has consistently claimed sovereignty over the KIG32 and the Scarborough Shoal for several decades, these outlying areas are located at an appreciable distance from the nearest shoreline of the Philippine archipelago, such that any straight baseline loped around them from the nearest basepoint will inevitably "depart to an appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago."

            """ The principal sponsor of Republic Act No. 9522 in the Senate, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, took pains to emphasize the foregoing during the Senate deliberations:

            <em>What we call the Kalayaan Island Group or what the rest of the world call the Spratlys and the Scarborough Shoal are outside our archipelagic baseline because if we put them inside our baselines we might be accused of violating the provision of international law which states: "The drawing of such baseline shall not depart to any appreciable extent from the general configuration of the archipelago." So sa loob ng ating baseline, dapat magkalapit ang mga islands. Dahil malayo ang Scarborough Shoal, hindi natin masasabing malapit sila sa atin although we are still allowed by international law to claim them as our own.</em>

            <em>This is called contested islands outside our configuration. We see that our archipelago is defined by the orange line which [we] call archipelagic baseline. Ngayon, tingnan ninyo ang maliit na circle doon sa itaas, that is Scarborough Shoal, itong malaking circle sa ibaba, that is Kalayaan Group or the Spratlys. Malayo na sila sa ating archipelago kaya kung ilihis pa natin ang dating archipelagic baselines para lamang masama itong dalawang circles, hindi na sila magkalapit at baka hindi na tatanggapin ng United Nations because of the rule that it should follow the natural configuration of the archipelago.</em>

            Hence, far from surrendering the Philippines' claim over the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal, Congress' decision to classify the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal as "Regimes of Islands' under the Republic of the Philippines consistent with Article 121" of UNCLOS III manifests the Philippine State's responsible observance of its pacta sunt servanda obligation under UNCLOS III. Under Article 121 of UNCLOS III, any "naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide," such as portions of the KIG, qualifies under the category of "regime of islands," whose islands generate their own applicable maritime zones.

            As their final argument against the validity of Republic Act No. 9522, petitioners contend that the law unconstitutionally "converts" internal waters into archipelagic waters, hence subjecting these waters to right of innocent and sea lanes passage under UNCLOS III, including overflight. Petitioners extrapolate that these passage right indubitably expose Philippine internal waters to nuclear and maritime pollution hazards, in violation of the constitution.

            Whether referred to as Philippine "internal waters" under Article I of the Constitution or as "archipelagic waters" under UNCLOS III (Article 49 [1]), the Philippines exercises sovereignty over the body of water lying landward of the baselines, including the air space over it and the submarine areas underneath.

            The fact of sovereignty, however, does not preclude the operation of municipal and international law norms subjecting the territorial sea or archipelagic waters to necessary, if not marginal, burdens in the interest of maintaining unimpeded, expeditious international navigation, consistent with the international law principle of freedom of navigation. Thus, domestically, the political branches of the Philippine government, in the competent discharge of their constitutional powers, may pass legislation designating routes within the archipelagic waters to regulate innocent and sea lanes passage. Indeed, bills drawing nautical highways for sea lanes passage are now pending in Congress.

            In the absence of municipal legislation, international law norms, now codified in UNCLOS III, operate to grant innocent passage rights over the territorial sea or archipelagic waters, subject to the treaty's limitations and conditions for their exercise. Significantly, the right of innocent passage is a customary international law, thus automatically incorporated in the corpus of Philippine law. No modern State can validly invoke its sovereignty to absolutely forbid innocent passage that is exercised in accordance with customary international law without risking retaliatory measures from the international community.

            The fact that for archipelagic States, their archipelagic waters are subject to both the right of innocent passage and sea lanes passage do not place them in lesser footing vis-à-vis continental coastal States which are subject, in their territorial sea, to the right of innocent passage and the right of transit passage through international straits. The imposition of these passage rights through archipelagic waters under UNCLOS III was a concession by archipelagic States, in exchange for their right to claim all the waters landward of their baselines, regardless of their depth or distance from the coast, as archipelagic waters subject to their territorial sovereignty. More importantly, the recognition of archipelagic States' archipelago and

Separate islands generate their own maritime zones, placing the waters between islands separated by more than 24 nautical miles beyond the States' territorial sovereignty, subjecting these waters to the rights of other States under UNCLOS III.

               Petitioners' invocation of non-executory provisions in Article II (Declaration of Principles and State Policies) must also fail. Our present state of jurisprudence considers the provisions in Article II as mere legislative guides, which, absent enabling legislation, "do not embody judicially enforceable constitutional rights x x x." Article II provisions serve as guides in formulating and interpreting implementing legislation, as well as in interpreting executory provisions of the Constitution. Although Oposa v. Factoran treated the right to a healthful and balanced ecology under Section 16 of Article II as an exception, the present petition lacks factual basis to substantiate the claimed constitutional violation. The other provisions petitioners cite, relating to the protection of marine wealth (Article XII, Section 2, paragraph 251) and subsistence fishermen (Article XIII, Section 752), are not violated by Republic Act No. 9522.

               In fact, the demarcation of the baselines enables the Philippines to delimit its exclusive economic zone, reserving solely to the Philippines the exploitation of all living and non-living resources within such zone. Such a maritime delineation binds the international community since the delineation is in strict observance of UNCLOS III. If the maritime delineation is contrary to UNCLOS III, the international community will of course reject it and will refuse to be bound by it.

               UNCLOS III favors States with a long coastline like the Philippines. UNCLOS III creates a sui generis maritime space the exclusive economic zone - in waters previously part of the high seas. UNCLOS III grants new rights to coastal States to exclusively exploit the resources found within this zone up to 200 nautical miles. UNCLOS III, however, preserves the traditional freedom of navigation of other States that are attached to this zone beyond the territorial sea before UNCLOS III.

               The enactment of UNCLOS III compliant baselines law for the Philippine archipelago and adjacent areas, as embodied in Republic Act No. 9522, allows an internationally recognized delimitation of the breadth of the Philippines' maritime zones and continental shelf.

               Republic Act No. 9522 is therefore a most vital step on the part of the Philippines in safeguarding its maritime zones, consistent with the Constitution and our nation interest.

            In 1947, Tomas Cloma, a Filipino adventurer and a fishing magnate, discovered several uninhabited and unoccupied groups of islands/islets in the vastness of the South China Sea. On May 11, 1956, together with 40 men, Tomas Cloma and his brother Filemon took formal possession of the islands, lying some 380 miles west of the southern end of Palawan and named it "Freedomland." Four days later, on May 15, 1956, Cloma issued and posted copies of his "Notice to the Whole World" on each of the islands as a decisive manifestation of unwavering claim over the territory.

            Then on May 31, 1956, Tomas Cloma declared the establishment of the Free Territory of Freedomland, 10 days after he sent his second representation to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, informing the latter that the territory claimed was named "Freedomland." On July 6, 1956, Cloma declared to the whole world his claim and the establishment of a separate government for the "Free Territory of Freedomland" with its capital on Flat Island (Patag Island). His declaration was met with violent and unfriendly reactions from several neighboring countries especially Taiwan when on September 24, 1956 it effectively garrisoned the nearby island of Itu Aba and intercepted Cloma's men and vessels found within its immediate waters.

            Unable to surmount the difficulties and pressure, he ceded his claim to the Philippines for one peso. On March 1976, President Marcos issued the Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1-76 organizing the Western Command based in Palawan in response to the heightening conflict of interest in the region and to abate any untoward incident. To further the claim of the Philippines, on June 11, 1978 President Marcos, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1596, formally annexed the Kalayaan Islands creating a distinct and separate Municipality known as "Kalayaan" under the political jurisdiction of the Province of Palawan, but under the custody of the Department of National Defense.

On December 2014, China published a "Position Paper on the Matter of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration initiated by the Republic of the Philippines." On June 21, 2013, the President of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, Judge Shunji Yanai, appointed Thomas A.

            """<b>The Sabah Issue</b>      
            Sabah is the easternmost of the 13 member states of Malaysia. It is located on the northern portion of the island of Borneo and the second largest state in the country after Sarawak. In the 1640s, the Spanish government in the Philippines signed peace treaties with the strongest sultanates, Sulu and Maguindanao, recognizing their de facto independence.

            The Sultan of Sulu became sovereign ruler of most of North Borneo in 1704 by virtue of a cession from the Sultan of Brunei whom he had helped in suppressing a rebellion which led to a 10- year civil war in Brunei. Due to the military aid from the Sulu sultan, the victor, Sultan Muaddin, later ceded Sabah to the Sulu sultan. However, there is no document stating the grant of North Borneo from Sultan of Brunei to Sultan of Sulu, but no one is questioning its veracity either.

            On September 12, 1762, the Sultanate of Sulu ceded the island of Balambangan to British East India Company, but later abandoned it in 1805. The British resumed contact with the Sultanate of Sulu in 1814 when Sir Stanford Raffles sent John Hunt on a failed mission to mend relations with sultanate. On January 22, 1878, Sir Alfred Dent obtained sovereign control over the northern part of Borneo for 5,300 ringgit ($5,000) from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu. Such concession was later confirmed by Her Majesty's Royal Charter in November, 1881 granted to the British North Borneo Co.

            In 1878, Sultan Mohammed Jamalul Alam of Sulu appointed Baron de Overbeck as Datu Bendajara and Raja of North Borneo. Baron de Overbeck, an Austrian national heavily connected with the house of Dent and Co. at Hong Kong who was sent to Borneo as a representative of Dent and Co. to enter negotiations with Sultans and Chiefs of Brunei and Sulu.

            On July 4, 1878, according to the letter of the Mohammed Jamalul Alam to the Captain-General of the Philippines, Sandakan was not ceded to the United Kingdom but was only leased. In 1892, Jose Rizal proposed to the Spanish government the establishment of a Filipino colony in Sabah, but the plan did not push through as it was rejected by Governor-General Eulogio Despujol.

            On December 18, 1939, the High Court of the State of North Borneo handed a decision in Civil Suit No. 169/39. The North Borneo Chief Justice C.F.C. Mackaskie stated that the heirs of the sultan of Sulu were legally entitled to the payment for North Borneo, which the decision called as "cession payment" on the basis of an English translation by Maxwell and Gibson.

            On May 27, 1961, the British government was due to grant Malaysia its independence which would include North Borneo (Sabah). It was during this time when then-President Diosdado Macapagal was forced to initiate the filing of the Philippine claim in North Borneo (Sabah) as it was being considered as a member of the proposed concept of Malaysia broached by Prime Minister Tengku Abduk Rahman in Singapore.

            On April 24, 1962, the Heirs of the Sultan of Sulu ceded sovereignty rights over Sabah to the Philippine Government. Then on August 16-September 5, 1963, the United Nations Malaysia Mission was sent to Sabah and Sarawak in order to assess if their population agreed in joining Malaysia.

            On September 16, 1963, the Federation of Malaysia came into being as a sovereign state, with North Borneo as one of the component states. On September 17, 1963, the Philippines refused to recognize Malaysia. The same act was done by Indonesia as both the Philippines and Indonesia rejected the UN findings and broke off diplomatic relations with Kuala Lumpur.

            In August-December 1967, the Marcos administration initiated the Jabidah unit training for their mission to destabilize Sabah. And on December 30, 1967, 135 of the 180 trainees of Jabidah were brought to Corregidor for "Special Training." But due to various untoward events, on March 18, 1968 the infamous Jabidah Massacre happened, killing all except two trainees who managed to escape the carnage. On March 28, 1968, Oplan Jabidah was exposed in a privilege speech of Senator Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.

            Then on February 12, 2013, the followers of Jamalul Kiram numbering over 200 men landed in Lahad Datu village in Sabah to take possession of their own territory and take it back from Malaysia. The incident resulted to the death or imprisonment of most of Kiram's followers.

            A government is the agency or machinery that carries out the will of the state. In its broad sense, to govern means to rule over or supervise, whether over a state, a set group of people, or a collection of people.

            It refers to the organization, machinery, or agency through which a political unit exercises authority and performs functions and which is usually classified according to the distribution of power within it. (www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/government accessed date: 3/4/2020)

            The government must be organized, exercising control over, and capable of maintaining law and order within the territory. It can be held internationally responsible for the acts of the inhabitants. The identity of the state is not affected by changes in the government.
            """,
            """<b>Form of Government</b>      
            The government as an entity comes in different forms as the people of the state may deem appropriate. The following are the major forms of government under international law:
            1. <b>Monarchy</b>  - is one in which the supreme authority is in the hands of a single person. Monarchies are classified into:
            <b>Absolute monarchy</b>  - one in which the ruler rules by divine right; and as the name suggests, the monarch has absolute rule over the lives of his subjects. Some authors call this government autocracy.
            <b>Limited monarchy</b> - one in which the ruler governs in accordance with a constitution. The monarch is just a symbolic head of the state and has no absolute control of the government or over the lives of his subjects. This is the form of modern monarchial states.

            2. <b>Aristocracy</b> - is a government in which political power is exercised by a few privileged individuals known as aristocrats. The term is derived from the Greek aristokratia, meaning rule of the best.

            <b>Oligarchy</b> is a form of aristocracy but the basis of leadership is the wealth of the rulers, meaning only the rich can have the reigns of the government. The term is derived from the Greek oligarkhía meaning to rule or to command.

            3. <b>Democracy</b> - is a government in which the political power is exercised by a majority of the people. The Term is derived from the Greek demokratía meaning rule of the people, which was derived from words demos meaning masses and kratos meaning power.

            The modern meaning of democracy is often attributed to the wordings of President Abraham Lincoln of the United States in his famous Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863 <em>"That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth"</em>

            <b> Direct or pure democracy</b>  - It is one in which the will of the State is formulated or expressed directly through the people in a mass meeting or assembly. This is attributed to the governmental system of ancient Athens where every citizen has the right to participate in governance.           

            <b> Indirect, representative or republican democracy</b>  a government in which the will of the State is formulated through a relatively small and select body of persons chosen by the people to act as their representatives. This is the most common type of democracy today.

            Based on Article II, Section 1 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the Philippines is a democratic and republican state. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.

            2. <b>Federal</b>   - one in which the power of the government is divided between two agencies, one for national affairs and the other for local affairs, each organ being supreme within its own jurisdiction. A good example of this kind is the government of the United States of America.

            3. <b>Parliamentary</b>   - a government in which the state confers upon the legislature the power to terminate the tenure of the executive. Under this system, the Cabinet or Ministry is immediately and legally responsible to the legislature and politically responsible to the electorate. The people in this system directly elect the members of the legislative department but cannot directly elect the members of the executive branch because the members of the legislative are the ones who elect the executives particularly the prime minister.   

            4. <b>Presidential</b> - a government where the executive is independent of the legislative as to tenure, policies, and acts. The president and the members of the legislative department are directly and separately elected by the people.

            5. <b>De Jure</b> - the administration of this government may or may not have the support of the people, but it is founded on existing constitutional laws of the state. The term de jure is a Latin expression which means concerning law.

            6. <b>De Facto</b> - the government is founded not on existing constitutional laws of the state, but it has the support of the majority of the people. The term de facto is a Latin expression which means <em>concerning fact</em>.

            """<b>Estrada vs. Arroyo, G.R. No. 146738, March 2, 2001</b>  

           On the line in the cases at bar is the office of the President. Petitioner Joseph Ejercito Estrada alleges that he is the President on leave while respondent Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo claims she is the President. The warring personalities are important enough, but more transcendental are the constitutional issues embedded on the parties' dispute. While the significant issues are many, the jugular issue involves the relationship between the ruler and the ruled in a democracy, Philippine style.

           Petitioner denies he resigned as President or that he suffers from a permanent disability. Hence, he submits that the office of the President was not vacant when respondent Arroyo took her oath as president.

           The issue then is whether the petitioner resigned as President or should be considered resigned as of January 20, 2001 when respondent took her oath as the 14th President of the Republic. Resignation is not a high-level legal abstraction. It is a factual question and its elements are beyond quibble: there must be an intent to resign and the intent must be coupled by acts of relinquishment. The validity of a resignation is not governed by any formal requirement as to form. It can be oral. It can be written. It can be expressed. It can be implied. As long as the resignation is clear, it must be given legal effect.

           In the cases at bar, the facts show that petitioner did not write any formal letter of resignation before he evacuated Malacañang Palace in the afternoon of January 20, 2001, after the oath-taking of respondent Arroyo. Consequently, whether or not petitioner resigned has to be determined from his acts and omissions before, during, and after January 20, 2001 or by the totality of prior, contemporaneous and posterior facts and circumstantial evidence bearing a material relevance on the issue. Using this totality test, We hold that petitioner resigned as President.

           In sum, We hold that the resignation of the petitioner cannot be doubted. It was confirmed by his leaving Malacañang. In the press release containing his final statement, (1) he acknowledged the oath- taking of the respondent as President of the Republic albeit with the reservation about its legality; (2) he emphasized he was leaving the Palace, the seat of the presidency, for the sake of peace and in order to begin the healing process of our nation. He did not say he was leaving the Palace due to any kind of inability and that he was going to re-assume the presidency as soon as the disability disappears; (3) he expressed his gratitude to the people for the opportunity to serve them. Without doubt, he was referring to the past opportunity given him to serve the people as President; (4) he assured that he will not shirk from any future challenge that may come ahead in the same service of our country. Petitioner's reference is to a future challenge after occupying the office of the president which he has given up: and (5) he called on his supporters to join him in the promotion of a constructive national spirit of reconciliation and solidarity. Certainly, the national spirit of reconciliation and solidarity could not be attained if he did not give up the presidency. The press release was petitioner's valedictory, his final act of farewell. His presidency is now in the past tense. In fine, even if the petitioner can prove that he did not resign, still, he cannot successfully claim that he is a President on leave on the ground that he is merely unable to govern temporarily.

           That claim has been laid to rest by Congress and the decision that respondent Arroyo is the de jure President made by a co-equal branch of government cannot be reviewed by this Court.

           It is well settled that as far as the rights of the predecessor government are concerned, they are inherited in toto by the successor government. As regards the obligations, distinction is made according to the manner of the establishment of the new government. The rule is that where the new government was organized by virtue of a constitutional reform duly ratified in a plebiscite, the obligations of the replaced government are also completely assumed by the former. In other words, in case of a revolution the new government may lawfully reject the purely personal or political obligations of the predecessor government but not those contracted by it in the ordinary course of official business.

            Parens patriae is Latin for "parent of his or her country." In juvenile justice legal system, parens patriae is a doctrine that allows the state to step in and serve as a guardian for children, the mentally ill, the incompetent, the elderly, or disabled persons who are unable to care for themselves. (https://study.com/academy/lesson/parens- patriae-in-juvenile-justice-definition-doctrine.html - accessed date:1/16/2020)
    
            The provisions of Articles 320 and 321 of the Civil Code provide that, "the father, or in his absence, the mother, is the legal administrator of the property pertaining to the child under parental authority. If the property is worth more than two thousand pesos, the father or mother shall give a bond subject to the approval of the Court of First Instance." The latter provides that "The property which the unemancipated child has acquired or may acquire with ownership, and in usufruct to the father or mother under whom he his work or industry, or by any lucrative title, belongs to the child in is under parental authority and whose company he lives.
    
            With the added circumstance that the child stays with the mother, not the uncle, without any evidence of lack of maternal care, the decision arrived at can stand the test of the strictest scrutiny. It is buttressed by its adherence to the concept that the judiciary. as an agency of the State acting as parens patriae, is called upon whenever a pending suit of litigation affects one who is a minor to accord priority to his best interest. This prerogative of parens patriae is inherent in the supreme power of every State, whether that power is lodged in a royal person or in the legislature, and has no affinity to those arbitrary powers which are sometimes exerted by irresponsible monarchs to the great detriment of the people and the destruction of their liberties." What is more, there is this constitutional provision vitalizing this concept. (Cabanas v. Pilapil, 58 SCRA 94, July 25, 1974)

            Subject of these consolidated cases is the extent of the powers of the President in pursuing the peace process. While the facts surrounding this controversy center on the armed conflict in Mindanao between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the legal issue involved has a bearing on all areas in the country where there has been a long-standing armed conflict. Yet again, the Court is tasked to perform a delicate balancing act.

            It must uncompromisingly delineate the bounds within which the President may lawfully exercise her discretion, but it must do so in strict adherence to the Constitution, lest its ruling, unduly restricts the freedom of action vested by that same Constitution in the Chief Executive precisely to enable her to pursue the peace process effectively.

            The sovereign people may, if it so desired, go to the extent of giving up a portion of its own territory to the Moros for the sake of peace, for it can change the Constitution in any way it wants, so long as the change is not inconsistent with what, in international law, is known as Jus Cogens. Respondents, however, may not preempt it in that decision.

            The MOA-AD cannot be reconciled with the present Constitution and laws. Not only its specific provisions but the very concept underlying them, namely, the associative relationship envisioned between the GRP and the BJE, are unconstitutional, for the concept presupposes that the associated entity is a state and implies that the same is on its way to independence.

            While there is a clause in the MOA-AD stating that the provisions thereof inconsistent with the present legal framework will not be effective until that framework is amended, the same does not cure its defect. The inclusion of provisions in the MOA- AD establishing an associative relationship between the BJE and the Central Government is, itself, a violation of the Memorandum of Instructions from the President dated March 1, 2001, addressed to the government peace panel. Moreover, as the clause is worded, it virtually guarantees that the necessary amendments to the Constitution and the laws will eventually be put in place. Neither the GRP Peace Panel nor the President herself is authorized to make such a guarantee. Upholding such an act would amount to authorizing a usurpation of the constituent powers vested only in Congress, a Constitutional Convention, or the people themselves through the process of initiative, for the only way that the Executive can ensure the outcome of the amendment process is through an undue influence or interference with that process.

            While the MOA-AD would not amount to an international agreement or unilateral declaration binding on the Philippines under international law, respondents' act of guaranteeing amendments is, by itself, already a constitutional violation that renders the MOA- AD fatally defective.

            Sovereignty is either internal or external. Internal sovereignty refers to the supreme power of the state to enforce the laws within its territorial jurisdiction. This is known as police power. External sovereignty, on the other hand, refers to the power of the state to be free from external or foreign control. This is known as independence.       
            """,
            """<b>Is Sovereignty Absolute?</b>   
            While sovereignty has traditionally been deemed absolute and all-encompassing on the domestic level, it is however subject to restrictions and limitations voluntarily agreed to by the Philippines, expressly or impliedly, as a member of the family of nations. Unquestionably, the Constitution did not envision a hermit-type isolation of the country from the rest of the world. In its Declaration of Principles and State Policies, the Constitution "adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land, and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation and amity, with all nations."

            By the doctrine of incorporation, the country is bound by generally accepted principles of international law, which are considered to be automatically part of our own laws. One of the oldest and most fundamental rules in international law is pacta sunt servanda - international agreements must be performed in good faith. "A treaty engagement is not a mere moral obligation but creates a legally binding obligation on the parties xxx. A state which has contracted valid international obligations is bound to make in its legislations such modifications as may be necessary to ensure the fulfillment of the obligations undertaken."

            By their inherent nature, treaties really limit or restrict the absoluteness of sovereignty. By their voluntary act, nations may surrender some aspects of their state power in exchange for greater benefits granted by or derived from a convention or pact. After all, states, like individuals, live with coequals, and in pursuit of mutually covenanted objectives and benefits, they also commonly agree to limit the exercise of their otherwise absolute rights. Thus, treaties have been used to record agreements between States concerning such widely diverse matters as, for example, the lease of naval bases, the sale or cession of territory, the termination of war, the regulation of conduct of hostilities, the formation of alliances, the regulation of commercial relations, the settling of claims, the laying down of rules governing conduct in peace and the establishment of international organizations. The sovereignty of a state therefore cannot in fact and in reality, be considered absolute. Certain restrictions enter into the picture: (1) limitations imposed by the very nature of membership in the family of nations and (2) limitations imposed by treaty stipulations. As aptly put by John F. Kennedy, "Today, no nation can build its destiny alone. The age of self-sufficient nationalism is over. The age of interdependence is here." (Tanada v. Angara, G.R.

Kazakhstan, 7. Kyrgyzstan, 8. Latvia, 9. Lithuania, 10. Moldova, 11. Russia, 12. Tajikistan, 13. Turkmenistan, 14. Ukraine, and 15. Uzbekistan.

            State may also become extinct due to several reasons. Czechoslovakia for example disappeared from the map of the world on January 1, 1993 due to voluntary dissolution which paved the way for the creation of two separate states - Czech Republic and the Republic of Slovakia. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was dissolved in November 1991 when war broke out between its former member states, particularly Serbia and Bosnia Herzegovina.

            On December 25, 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, declaring his office extinct, and handed over the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. That same evening, the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and replaced with the Russian tricolor. Two weeks later, eight of the remaining nine republics signed the Alma-Ata Protocol formally establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States and declaring that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) is dissolved. The dissolution of the state also marked an end to the Cold War.

            """<b>Introduction</b>   
            One of the characteristics of a good constitution is being a comprehensive document that serves as the foundation of the state. The constitution prescribes the permanent framework of a system of government, assigns to the different departments their respective powers and duties, and establishes certain fixed principles on which government is founded. These provisions of the constitution are construed as belonging to the category of non self-executing provision. The very terms of the provisions manifest that they are only principles upon which the legislations must be based. <em>Res ipsa loquitur.</em>    

            The Supreme Court has been consistently holding that the provisions in Article II of the Constitution entitled Declaration of Principles and State Policies should generally be construed as mere statements of principles of the State. It was also ruled that some provisions of Article XIII on Social Justice and Human Rights and Article XIV on Education Science and Technology, Arts, Culture and Sports, cannot be the basis of judicially enforceable rights. Their enforcement is addressed to the discretion of Congress though they provide the framework for legislation to effectuate their policy content. (Manila Prince Hotel v. Government Service Insurance System, G.R. No. 122156, February 3, 1997)

            The provisions of Article II of the 1987 Constitution, the declarations of principles and state policies, are not self-executing. Legislative failure to pursue such policies cannot give rise to a cause of action in the courts. (Espina v. Zamora, G.R. No. 143855, September 21, 2010)
            """,
            """<b>Republicanism</b>   
            The Philippines is a democratic and republican State. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them. (Section 1, Article II)

            The word republic is derived from the Latin noun-phrase res publica which means thing of the people. It refers to the system of government that emerged in the 6th century BC following the expulsion of the kings from Rome by Lucius Junius Brutus and Collatinus. (Mortimer N. S. Sellers. American Republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States Constitution, New York University Press, 1994, p. 71) It is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter," not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied. It has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and has therefore no monarch as head of state. (Bohn, H. The Standard Library Cyclopedia of Political, Constitutional, Statistical and Forensic Knowledge, 1949, p. 640)

            Fundamental to the idea of a democratic and republican state is the right of the people to determine their own destiny through the choice of leaders they may have in government. Republicanism, in so far as it implies the adoption of a representative type of government, necessarily points to the enfranchised citizen as a particle of popular sovereignty and as the ultimate source of the established authority. He has a voice in his Government and whenever possible, it is the solemn duty of the judiciary, when called upon to act in justifiable cases, to give it efficacy and not to stifle or frustrate it. This, fundamentally, is the reason for the rule that ballots should be read and appreciated, if not with utmost, with reasonable, liberality. It has also been said that "competition in ideas and governmental policies is at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms." (GMA Network v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 205357, September 2, 2014)
            """,
            """<b>Renunciation of War</b>
            The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land, and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations. (Section 2, Article II) This Constitutional provision is an incorporation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, or the so-called Pact of Paris on August 27, 1928. This multilateral agreement was an effort to eliminate war as an instrument of national policy. It was intended as a grand plan of peacekeeping efforts after World War I.

            But it should be emphasized that the Philippines together with all the states in the world is not required under any agreement or treaty to renounce war as an act of self-defense or self-preservation. What the Kellogg-Briand Pact required the states to renounce was a war of aggression for being contrary to the principles of peaceful relations with other states of the world.

            By the doctrine of incorporation, the country is bound by generally accepted principles of international law, which are considered to be automatically part of our own laws. (Tañada v. Angara, G.R. No. 118295, May 2, 1997)

            International law is part of our law and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination. For this purpose, where there is no treaty and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be to the customs and usages of civilized nations, and, as evidence of these, to the works of jurists and commentators who by years of labor, research, and experience have made themselves peculiarly well acquainted with the subjects of which they treat. Such works are resorted to by judicial tribunals, not for the speculations of their authors concerning what the law ought to be, but for the trustworthy evidence of what the law really is.

            """<b>Supremacy of Civilian Authority</b>
            Indeed, while the President is still a civilian, Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution mandates that civilian authority is, at all times, supreme over the military, making the civilian president the nation's supreme military leader. The net effect of Article II, Section 3, when read with Article VII, Section 18, is that a civilian President is the ceremonial, legal and administrative head of the armed forces. The Constitution does not require that the President must be possessed of military training and talents, but as Commander-in-Chief, he has the power to direct military operations and to determine military strategy. Normally, he would be expected to delegate the actual command of the armed forces to military experts; but the ultimate power is his. As Commander-in-Chief, he is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual. (Kulayan v.

(Section 4, Article II)

            The National Defense Law, in so far as it establishes compulsory military service, does not go against this constitutional provision but is, on the contrary, in faithful compliance therewith. The duty of the Government to defend the State cannot be performed except through an army. To leave the organization of an army to the will of the citizens would be to make this duty of the Government excusable should there be no sufficient men who volunteer to enlist therein. (People v.

            Pursuant to the Constitutional mandate, the government may call upon the people to defend the State and, in the fulfillment thereof, all citizens may be required, under conditions provided by law, to render personal, military, or civil service. Congress enacted Republic Act No. 9163 on January 23, 2002 requiring among others that a National Service Training Program (NSTP) shall form part of the curricula of all baccalaureate degree courses and of at least two- year technical vocational courses and is a requisite for graduation, consisting of the following service components: (1) The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), which is hereby made option and voluntary upon the effectivity of this Act; (2) The Literacy Training Service; and (3) The Civic Welfare Training Service.

            """<b>Separation of Church and State</b>
            The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable. (Section 6, Article II) "Good fences make good neighbors," declared Robert Frost, in his 1914 poem Mending Wall. The Bible also quoted Jesus saying that "So give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." (Matthew 22:21)

            The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable. The Court once pronounced that "our history, not to speak of the history of mankind, has taught us that the union of church and state is prejudicial to both, for occasions might arise when the state will use the church, and the church the state, as a weapon in the furtherance of their respective ends and aims."

            The rationale of the rule is summed up in the familiar saying. "Strong fences make good neighbors." The idea is to delineate the boundaries between the two institutions and, thus, avoid encroachments by one against the other because of a misunderstanding of the limits of their respective exclusive jurisdictions. The demarcation line calls on the entities to "render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's."

            This, notwithstanding, the State still recognizes the inherent right of the people to have some form of belief system, whether such may be belief in a Supreme Being, a certain way of life, or even an outright rejection of religion. Our very own Constitution recognizes the heterogeneity and religiosity of our people as reflected in Imbong v. Ochoa, as follows: At the outset, it cannot be denied that we all live in a heterogeneous society. It is made up of people of diverse ethnic, cultural, and religious beliefs and backgrounds. History has shown us that our government, in law and in practice, has allowed these various religious, cultural, social, and racial groups to thrive in a single society together. It has embraced minority groups and is tolerant towards all the religious people of different sects and the non-believers. The undisputed fact is that our people generally believe in a deity, whatever they conceived Him to be, and to Whom they called for guidance and enlightenment in crafting our fundamental law.

            In May 1936, the Director of Posts announced in the dailies of Manila that he would order the issuance of postage stamps commemorating the celebration in the City of Manila of the thirty- third international Eucharistic Congress, organized by the Roman Catholic Church. The petitioner, in the fulfillment of what he considers to be a civic duty, requested Vicente Sotto, Esq., member of the Philippine Bar, to denounce the matter to the President of the Philippines.

            The Court ruled that "We are much impressed with the vehement appeal of counsel for the petitioner to maintain inviolate the complete separation of church and state and curb any attempt to infringe by indirection a constitutional inhibition. Indeed, in the Philippines, once the scene of religious intolerance and prescription, care should be taken that at this stage of our political development nothing is done by the Government or its officials that may lead to the belief that the Government is taking sides or favoring a particular religious sect or institution. But, upon very serious reflection, examination of Act No. 4052, and scrutiny of the attending circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that there has been no constitutional infraction in the case at bar, Act No. 4052 grants the Director of Posts, with the approval of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, discretion to misuse postage stamps with new designs "as often as may be deemed advantageous to the Government." Even if we were to assume that these officials made use of a poor judgment in issuing and selling the postage stamps in question still, the case of the petitioner would fail to take in weight. Between the exercise of a poor judgment and the unconstitutionality of the step taken, a gap exists which is yet to be filled to justify the court in setting aside the official act assailed as coming within a constitutional inhibition."

            """<b>Social Justice and Human Rights</b>
            The State shall promote social justice in all phases of national development. (Section 10, Article II)

            Social justice and human rights are two issues that are highlighted in the 1987 Constitution. Social justice is all about working towards a more equal society including ensuring that people are treated with dignity and respect by those with public power, also the main goal of human rights. On the other hand, human rights are the rules on how the state should treat individuals regardless of their gender, socio-economic status, political, religious, or philosophical color. Human rights can be a powerful tool to enable the society to attain social justice.

            In the wordings of the Supreme Court, "social justice is neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy," but the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated. Social justice means the promotion of the welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society, through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise of powers underlying the existence of all governments on the time-honored principle of salus populi est suprema lex. Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of the necessity of interdependence among divers and diverse units of a society and of the protection that should be equally and evenly extended to all groups as a combined force in our social and economic life, consistent with the fundamental and paramount objective of the state of promoting the health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and of bringing about "the greatest good to the greatest number." (Calalang v. Williams, G.R. No. 47800, December 2, 1940)

            The policy of social justice is not intended to countenance wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the underprivileged. At best it may mitigate the penalty but it certainly will not condone the offense. Compassion for the poor is an imperative of every humane society but only when the recipient is not a rascal claiming an undeserved privilege. Social justice cannot be permitted to be refuge of scoundrels any more than can equity be an impediment to the punishment of the guilty. Those who invoke social justice may do so only if their hands are clean and their motives blameless and not simply because they happen to be poor. This great policy of our Constitution is not meant for the protection of those who have proved they are not worthy of it, like the workers who have tainted the cause of labor with the blemishes of their own character. (Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company u. The National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 80609, August 23, 1988)
            """,
            """<b>Sanctity of the Family and Human Dignity</b>
            The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government. (Section 12, Article II)

            Textually, the Constitution affords protection to the unborn from conception. This is undisputable because before conception, there is no unborn to speak of. For said reason, it is no surprise that the Constitution is mute as to any proscription prior to conception or when life begins. The problem has arisen because, amazingly. there are quarters who have conveniently disregarded the scientific fact that conception is reckoned from fertilization. They are waving the view that life begins at implantation. Hence, the issue of when life begins.

            One of the primary and basic rules in statutory construction is that where the words of a statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, they must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation. It is a well-settled principle of constitutional construction that the language employed in the Constitution must be given their ordinary meaning except where technical terms are employed. As much as possible, the words of the Constitution should be understood in the sense they have in common use. What it says according to the text of the provision to be construed, compels acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the people from the mean what they say. Verba legis non est recedendum words of a statute there should be no departure.

            The raison d'etre for the rule is essentially two-fold: First, because it is assumed that the words in which constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained; and second, because the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer's document but essentially that of the people, in whose consciousness it should ever be present as an important condition for the rule of law to prevail.

It shall inculcate in the building and shall promote and protect their physical, moral, youth patriotism and nationalism and encourage their involvement in public and civic affairs. (Section 13, Article II)

            Youth is the time of life when one is young and often means the time between childhood and adulthood. It is also defined as "the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young." (Macmillan Dictionary, Macmillan Publishers Limited) The youth is important as they will constitute the future citizens of the country, as such, even Jose Rizal considered them as "fair hope of my fatherland," in his poem, A la Juventud Filipina.

            Republic Act No. 7610 is a measure geared towards the implementation of a national comprehensive program for the survival of the most vulnerable members of the population, the Filipino children, in keeping with the Constitutional mandate under Article XV, Section 3, paragraph 2, that "The State shall defend the right of the children to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special protection from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development." (Torres v. People, G.R. No. 206627, January 18, 2017)

            To put things in proper perspective, it must be pointed out that Republic Act No. 7610 was meant to advance the state policy of affording "special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, and discrimination and other conditions prejudicial to their development" and in such regard, "provide sanctions for their commission." It also furthers the "best interests of children" and as such, its provisions are guided by this standard. Driven by the foregoing considerations, Congress crafted Article III of the same law in order to penalize child prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse. Section 5 thereof provides a definition of who is considered a "child exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse." (Caballo v. People, G.R. No. 198732, June 10, 2013)

            The State recognizes the role of women in nation-building and shall ensure the fundamental equality before the law of women and men. (Section 14, Article II)

            Several legislations intended to protect women have been enacted over the years pursuant to the country's commitment to the Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), e.g., Republic Act No. 9262, the law against Violence on Women and their Children; Republic Act No. 9710, the Magna Carta of Women; Republic Act 10151, the Night Workers Law; Republic Act No. 11210, the Expanded Maternity Leave Law; and the likes.

            As the Supreme Court ruled, the guaranty of equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty of equality in the application of the laws upon all citizens of the state. It is not, therefore, a requirement, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition against inequality, that every man, woman and child should be affected alike by a statute. Equality of operation of statutes does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to the circumstances surrounding them. It guarantees equality, not identity of rights. The Constitution does not require that things which are different in fact be treated in law as though they were the same. The equal protection clause does not forbid discrimination as to things that are different. It does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate.

            The equal protection of the laws clause of the Constitution allows classification. Classification in law, as in the other departments of knowledge or practice, is the grouping of things in speculation or practice because they agree with one another in certain particulars. A law is not invalid because of simple inequality. The very idea of classification is that of inequality so that it goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality. All that is required of a valid classification is that it be reasonable, which means that the classification should be based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences; that it must be germane to the purpose of the law; that it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and that it must apply equally to each member of the class. This Court has held that the standard is satisfied if the classification or distinction is based on a reasonable foundation or rational basis and is not palpably arbitrary.

            Measured against the foregoing jurisprudential yardstick, w equal protection clause by favoring women over men as victims of as shall hereinafter be discussed and, as such, did not violate the find that Republic Act No. 9262 is based on a valid classification violence and abuse to whom the State extends its protection.

            The State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rythm and harmony of nature. (Section 16, Article II)

            This case, however, has a special and novel element. Petitioners who are minors assert that they represent their generation as well yet unborn. We find no difficulty in ruling that they can, for themselves, for others of their generations can only be based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility in so far as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned. Such a right, as hereinafter expounded, considers the "rhythm and harmony of nature." Nature means the created world in its entirety. Such rhythm and harmony indispensably include, inter alia, the judicious disposition, utilization, management, renewal and conservation of the country's forest, mineral, land, waters, fisheries, wildlife, off-shore areas and other natural resources to the end that their exploration, development and utilization be equitably accessible to the present as well as future generations. Needless to say, every generation has a responsibility to the next to preserve that rhythm and harmony for the full enjoyment of a balanced and healthful ecology. Put a little differently, the minors' assertion of their right to a sound environment constitutes, at the same time, the performance of their obligation to ensure the protection of that right for the generations to come.

            While the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is to be found under the Declaration of Principles and State Policies and not under the Bill of Rights, it does not follow that it is less important than any of the civil and political rights enumerated in the latter.

            Such a right belongs to a different category of rights altogether for it concerns nothing less than self-preservation and self-perpetuation -aptly and fittingly stressed by the petitioners-the advancement of which may even be said to predate all governments and constitutions. As a matter of fact, these basic rights need not even be written in the Constitution for they are assumed to exist from the inception of humankind. If they are now explicitly mentioned in the fundamental charter, it is because of the well-founded fear of its framers that unless the rights to a balanced and healthful ecology and to health are mandated as state policies by the Constitution itself, thereby highlighting their continuing importance and imposing upon the state a solemn obligation to preserve the first and protect and advance the second, the day would not be too far when all else would be lost not only for the present generation but which stand to inherit nothing also for those to come- but parched earth incapable of sustaining life.

            Conformably, with the enunciated right to a balanced and healthful ecology and the right to health, as well as the other related provisions of the Constitution concerning the conservation, development, and utilization of the country's natural resources, then President Corazon C. Aquino promulgated on June 10, 1987 Executive Order No. 192, Section 4 of which expressly mandates that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources "shall be the primary government agency responsible for the conservation, management, development and proper use of the country's environment and natural resources, specifically forest and grazing lands, mineral, resources, including those in reservation and watershed areas, and lands of the public domain, as well as the licensing and regulation of all natural resources as may be provided for by law in order to ensure equitable sharing of the benefits derived therefrom for the welfare of the present and future generations of Filipinos." (Oposa v. Factoran, G.R. No. 101083, July 30, 1993)

            The MMDA is duty-bound to comply with Section 41 of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003) which prescribes the minimum criteria for the establishment of sanitary landfills and Section 42 which provides the minimum operating requirements that each site operator shall maintain in the operation of a sanitary landfill. Complementing Section 41 are Sections 36 and 37 of Republic Act No. 9003, enjoining the MMDA and local government units, among others, after the effectivity of the law on February 15, 2001, from using and operating open dumps for solid waste and dissallowing, five years after such effectivity, the use of controlled dumps.

            One of the country's development objectives is enshrined in Republic Act No. 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004. This law stresses that the State shall pursue a policy of economic growth in a manner consistent with the protection, preservation, and revival of the quality of our fresh, brackish, and marine waters. It also provides that it is the policy of the government, among others, to streamline processes and procedures in the prevention, control, and abatement of pollution mechanisms for the protection of water resources; to promote environmental strategies and use of appropriate economic instruments and of control mechanisms for the protection of water resources; to formulate a holistic national program of water quality management that recognizes that issues related to this management cannot be separated from concerns about water sources and ecological protection, water supply, public health, and quality of life; and to provide a comprehensive management program for water pollution focusing on pollution prevention.

            In the light of the ongoing environmental degradation, the Court wishes to emphasize the extreme necessity for all concerned executive departments and agencies to immediately act and discharge their respective official duties and obligations. Indeed, time is of the essence; hence, there is a need to set timetables for the performance and completion of the tasks, some of them as defined by law and the nature of their respective offices and mandates.

            The importance of the Manila Bay as a sea resource, playground, and as a historical landmark cannot be over-emphasized. It is not yet too late in the day to restore the Manila Bay to its former splendor and bring back the plants and sea life that once thrived in its blue waters. But the tasks ahead, daunting as they may be, could only be accomplished if those mandated, with the help and cooperation of all civic-minded individuals, would put their minds to these tasks and take responsibility. This means that the State, through petitioners, has to take the lead in the preservation and protection of the Manila Bay.

            The era of delays, procrastination, and ad hoc measures is over. Petitioners must transcend their limitations, real or imaginary, and buckle down to work before the problem at hand becomes unmanageable. Thus, we must reiterate that different government agencies and instrumentalities cannot shirk from their mandates; they must perform their basic functions in cleaning up and rehabilitating the Manila Bay. We are disturbed by petitioners hiding behind two untenable claims: (1) that there ought to be a specific pollution incident before they are required to act; and (2) that the cleanup of the bay is a discretionary duty.

            Republic Act No. 9003 is a sweeping piece of legislation enacted to radically transform and improve waste management. It implements Section 16, Article II of the 1987 Constitution, which explicitly provides that the State shall protect and advance the rights of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature.

            The heads of petitioners-agencies MMDA, DENR, DepEd, DOH, DA, DPWH, DBM, PCG, PNP Maritime Group, DILG, and also of MWSS, LWUA, and PPA, in line with the principle of "continuing mandamus," shall, from finality of this Decision, each submit to the Court a quarterly progressive report of the activities undertaken in accordance with this Decision.

            The State shall give priority to education, science and technology, arts, culture, and sports to foster patriotism and nationalism, accelerate social progress, and promote total human liberation and development. (Section 17, Article II)

            Section 1. The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all. (Section 1, Article XIV)

            Education is a government priority in the 1987 Constitution. In order to give life to this constitutional mandate, Congress has enacted various laws like Republic Act No. 9155, the Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001; Republic Act No. 7796, the Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994; Republic Act No. 7722, the Higher Education Act of 1994; Republic Act No. 7662, the Legal Education Reform Act of 1993; Republic Act No. 6655, the Free Public Secondary Education Act of 1988; Republic Act No. 10157, the Kindergarten Education Act which required all children to undergo kindergarten education before entering Grade I; and Republic Act No. 10533, Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 which established Grade 11 and Grade 12 as part of Senior High School Education for all Filipino Students. In order to provide education assistance in both public and private institutions, Republic Act No. 10687, the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (UniFAST) Act was enacted. Moreover, Republic Act No. 10931, the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act was enacted to provide free higher education in all state and local colleges and universities. These laws are in addition to the Education Act of 1982, Batas Pambansa Blg. 232.

            """<b>Right to Education </b>
            What cannot be stressed too sufficiently is that among the most important social, economic, and cultural rights is the right to education not only in the elementary and high school grades but also on the college level. The constitutional provision as to the State maintaining "a system of free public elementary education and, in areas where finances permit, establish and maintain a system of free public education" up to the high school level does not per se exclude the exercise of that right in colleges and universities. It is only at the most a reflection of the lack of sufficient funds for such a duty to be obligatory in the case of students in the colleges and universities. As far as the right itself is concerned, not the effectiveness of the exercise of such right because of the lack of funds, Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides: "Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit." (Villar v. Technological Institute of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-69198, April 17, 1985)

            """<b>Academic Freedom</b>
            Academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning. (Section 5[2], Article XIV)

            This institutional academic freedom includes the right of the school or college to decide for itself, its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. The essential freedoms subsumed in the term "academic freedom" encompasses the freedom to determine for itself on academic grounds: (1) Who may teach, (2) What may be taught, (3) How it shall be taught, and (4) Who may be admitted to study.

            The right of the school to discipline its students is at once apparent in the third freedom, i.e., "how it shall be taught." A school certainly cannot function in an atmosphere of anarchy. Thus, there can be no doubt that the establishment of an educational institution requires rules and regulations necessary for the maintenance of an orderly educational program and the creation of an educational environment conducive to learning. Such rules and regulations are equally necessary for the protection of the students, faculty, and property. (Miriam College Foundation, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127930, December 15, 2000)

            Article XIV, Section 5(2) of the Constitution provides that, "academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher Learning." This is nothing new. The 1935 Constitution and the 1973 Constitution likewise provided for the academic freedom or, more precisely, for the institutional autonomy of universities and nstitutions of higher learning. As pointed out by this Court in Garcia Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology, it is a reedom granted to "institutions of higher learning" which is thus iven "a wide sphere of authority certainly extending to the choice of students." If such institution of higher learning can decide who can and who cannot study in it, it certainly can also determine on whom it can confer the honor and distinction of being its graduates.

                 Where it is shown that the conferment of an honor or distinction was obtained through fraud, a university has the right to revoke or withdraw the honor or distinction it has thus conferred. This freedom of a university does not terminate upon the "graduation" of a student, as the Court of Appeals held. For it is precisely the "graduation" of such a student that is in question. Wide indeed is the sphere of autonomy granted to institutions of higher learning, for the constitutional grant of academic freedom, to quote again from Garcia v. Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology, "is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a grudging fashion."

            Under the U.P. Charter, the Board of Regents is the highest governing body of the University of the Philippines. It has the power to confer degrees upon the recommendation of the University Council. It follows that if the conferment of a degree is founded on error or fraud, the Board of Regents is also empowered, subject to the observance of due process, to withdraw what it has granted without violating a student's rights. An institution of higher learning cannot be powerless if it discovers that an academic degree it has conferred is not rightfully deserved. Nothing can be more objectionable than bestowing a university's highest academic degree upon an individual who has obtained the same through fraud or deceit. The pursuit of academic excellence is the university's concern. It should be empowered, as an act of self-defense, to take measures to protect itself from serious threats to its integrity. While it is true that the students are entitled to the right to pursue their education, the USC as an educational institution is also entitled to pursue its academic freedom and, in the process, has the concomitant right to see to it that this freedom is not jeopardized. (University of the Philippines Board of Regents v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 134625, August 31, 1999)

            Justice Frankfurter, with his extensive background in legal education as a former Professor of the Harvard Law School, referred to what he called the business of a university and the four essential freedoms in the following language: "It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail "the four essential freedoms" of a university to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study."

            The State affirms labor as a primary social economic force. It shall protect the rights of workers and promote their welfare. (Section 18, Article II)

            The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.

            It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision- making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.

            The State shall promote the principle of shared responsibility between workers and employers and the preferential use of voluntary modes in settling disputes, including conciliation, and shall enforce their mutual compliance therewith to foster industrial peace.

            The State shall regulate the relations between workers and employers, recognizing the right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right of enterprises to reasonable returns to investments, and to expansion and growth. (Section 3, Article XIII)

            Labor simply means physical toil. It could also mean productive work especially physical work done for wages. Labor may refer to a social class comprising those who do manual labor or work for wages. (Duka, Labor Laws and Social Legislations, p. 1, 2019)

            If we have taken pains to delve into the background of the labor provisions in our Constitution and the Labor Code, it is but to stress that the right of an employee not to be dismissed from his job except for a just or authorized cause provided by law has assumed greater importance under the 1987 Constitution with the singular prominence labor enjoys under the article on Social Justice. And this transcendent policy has been translated into law in the Labor Code. Under its terms, where a case of unlawful or unauthorized itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study."

            """<b>Economy Controlled by Filipinos</b>
            The State shall develop a self-reliant and independent national economy effectively controlled by Filipinos. (Section 19, Article II) 

            Republic Act No. 8762 allows natural-born Filipino citizens, who had lost their citizenship and now reside in the Philippines, to engage in the retail trade business with the same rights as Filipino citizens.

            In other words, while Section 19, Article II of the 1987 Constitution requires the development of a self-reliant and independent national economy effectively controlled by Filipino entrepreneurs, it does not impose a policy of Filipino monopoly of the economic environment. The objective is simply to prohibit foreign powers or interests from maneuvering our economic policies and ensure that Filipinos are given preference in all areas of development.

            Indeed, the 1987 Constitution takes into account the realities of the outside world as it requires the pursuit of a trade policy that serves the general welfare and utilizes all forms and arrangements of exchange on the basis of equality and reciprocity; and speaks of industries which are competitive in both domestic and foreign markets as well as of the protection of Filipino enterprises against unfair foreign competition and trade practices. Thus, while the Constitution mandates a bias in favor of Filipino goods, services, labor, and enterprises, it also recognizes the need for business exchange with the rest of the world on the bases of equality and reciprocity and limits protection of Filipino enterprises only against foreign competition and trade practices that are unfair.

            In other words, the 1987 Constitution does not rule out the not encourage their unlimited entry into the country, it does not entry of foreign investments, goods, and services. While it does prohibit them either. In fact, it allows an exchange on the basis of equality and reciprocity, frowning only on foreign competition that is unfair. The key, as in all economies in the world, is to strike a balance between protecting local businesses and allowing the entry of foreign investments and services. (Espina v. Zamora, G.R.

            """<b>Agrarian Form</b>
            The State shall promote comprehensive rural development and agrarian reform. (Section 21, Article II)     

            Agrarian Reform means the redistribution of lands, regardless of crops or fruits produced to farmers and regular farmworkers who are landless, irrespective of tenurial arrangement, to include the totality of factors and support services designed to lift the economic status of the beneficiaries and all other arrangements alternative to the physical redistribution of lands, such as production or profit- sharing, labor administration, and the distribution of shares of stocks, which will allow beneficiaries to receive a just share of the fruits of the lands they work. (Section 3[a], Republic Act No. 6657)

            The spirit of agrarian reform laws is not to distribute lands per se, but to enable the landless to own land for cultivation. This is why the basic qualification laid down for the intended beneficiary is to show the willingness, aptitude and ability to cultivate and make the land as productive as possible. This requirement conforms with the policy direction set in the 1987 Constitution to the effect that agrarian reform laws shall be founded on the right of the landless farmers and farmworkers to own, directly or collectively, the lands they till. (Holy Trinity Realty & Development Corporation v. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 200454, October 22, 2014)

            The enactment of Republic Act No. 6657, or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, has placed suitable agricultural lands under the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. Under Republic Act No. 6657, Section 2, this government program aims to promote social justice and industrialization. (Land Bank of the Philippines v. Manzano, G.R. No. 188243, January 24, 2018)

            All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State. With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated. The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State. The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens. Such agreements may be for a period not exceeding 25 years, renewable for not more than 25 years, and under such terms and conditions as may be provided by law. In cases of water rights for irrigation, water supply fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of waterpower, beneficial use may be the measure and limit of the grant. (Section 2, Article XII)

            All lands of the public domain belong to the State. It is the fountain from which springs any asserted right of ownership over land. Accordingly, the State owns all lands that are not clearly within private ownership. This is the Regalian Doctrine which has been incorporated in all of our Constitutions and repeatedly embraced in jurisprudence. Under the present Constitution, lands of the public domain are not alienable except for agricultural lands. (Republic v. Tan, G.R. No. 199537, February 10, 2016)

            The first sentence of Section 2 embodies the Regalian doctrine or jura regalia. Introduced by Spain into the Philippines, this feudal concept is based on the States power of dominium, which is the capacity of the State to own or acquire property. Traditionally, the term jura regalia refers to royal rights, or those rights which the King has by virtue of his regal or royal prerogatives. In Spanish law, it refers to a right which the sovereign has over anything in which a  subject has a right of property. The theory of the feudal system was that the title to all lands was originally held by the King, and while the use of lands was granted out to others who were permitted to the title. By fiction of law, the King was regarded as the original hold them under certain conditions, the King theoretically retained proprietor of all lands, and the true and only source of title, and from him all lands were held. The theory of jura regalia was therefore nothing more than a natural fruit of conquest. The Philippines was considered as property of the Spanish Crown by virtue of the supposed discovery and conquest, as such Spanish decrees proclaimed that all lands were held from the Crown. The Regalian doctrine extends not only to land but also to all-natural wealth that may be found in the bowels of the earth. Spain recognized the unique value of natural resources. (Adopted from Agcaoili, Property Registration and Related Decrees, 2006)

            Preliminarily, it must be pointed out that the classification of land as agricultural constitutes a primary classification. Section 3, Article XII of the Constitution provides for the primary classification of lands of the public domain into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks. The same provision of the Constitution also provides that agricultural lands of the public domain may be further classified according to the uses to which they may be devoted. This further classification of agricultural lands is referred to as secondary classification.

            The authority to reclassify agricultural lands into residential, commercial or industrial is lodged, among others, in cities and municipalities (hereinafter, LGUs). Prior to the passage of the present Local Government Code of 1991, LGUs already have the power to reclassify agricultural into non-agricultural lands pursuant to Section 3 of Republic Act No. 2264, otherwise known as the "Local Autonomy Act of 1959," which empowered municipal and/or city councils to adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances or regulations in consultation with the National Planning Commission.

            Section 25. The State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments. (Section 25, Article II)

            It is hereby declared the policy of the State that the territorial and political subdivisions of the State shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals. Toward this end, the State shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the national government to the local government units. (Section 2[a], Republic Act No. 7160)

            One of the key features of the 1987 Constitution is its push towards decentralization of government and local autonomy. Local autonomy has two facets, the administrative and the fiscal. Fiscal autonomy means that local governments have the power to create their own sources of revenue in addition to their equitable share in the national taxes released by the National Government, as well as the power to allocate their resources in accordance with their own priorities. Such autonomy is as indispensable to the viability of the policy of decentralization as the other. Implementing the constitutional mandate for decentralization and local autonomy, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code (LGC), in order to guarantee the fiscal autonomy of the LGUs. (Mandanas v. Ochoa, G.R. No. 199802, July 3,2018)

            Under the Philippine concept of local autonomy, the national government has not completely relinquished all its powers over local governments, including autonomous regions. Only administrative powers over local affairs are delegated to political subdivisions. The purpose of the delegation is to make governance more directly responsive and effective at the local levels. In turn, economic, political, and social development at the smaller political units is expected to propel social and economic growth and development. But to enable the country to develop holistically, the programs and policies effected locally must be integrated and coordinated towards a common national goal. Thus, policy-setting for the entire country still lies in the President and Congress.

            Under existing law, local government units, in addition to having administrative autonomy in the exercise of their functions, enjoy fiscal autonomy as well. Fiscal autonomy means that local governments have the power to create their own sources of revenue in addition to their equitable share in the national taxes released by the national government, as well as the power to allocate their resources in accordance with their own priorities. It extends to the preparation of their budgets, and local officials in turn have to work within the constraints thereof. They are not formulated at the national level and imposed on local governments, whether they are relevant to local needs and resources or not. Hence, the necessity of balancing of viewpoints and the harmonization of proposals from both local and national officials, who in any case are partners in the attainment of national goals.

            The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law. (Section 26, Article II)

            The "equal access" provision is a subsumed part of Article II of the Constitution, entitled "Declaration of Principles and State Policies." The provisions under the Article are generally considered not self-executing, and there is no plausible reason for according a different treatment to the "equal access" provision. Like the rest of the policies enumerated in Article II, the provision does not contain any judicially enforceable constitutional right but merely specifies a guideline for legislative or executive action. The disregard of the provision does not give rise to any cause of action before the courts. An inquiry into the intent of the framers produces the same determination that the provision is not self-executory. The original wording of the present Section 26, Article II had read, "The State shall broaden opportunities to public office and prohibit public dynasties." (Pamatong v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 161872, April 13, 2004)

            It might be worth mentioning that Section 26, Article II, of the Constitution also states that the "State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law." I see neither Article IX(C)(4) nor Section 26, Article II, of the Constitution to be all that adversarial or irreconcilably inconsistent with the right of free expression. In any event, the latter, being one of general application, must yield to the specific demands of the Constitution. The freedom of expression concededly holds, it is true, a vantage point in hierarchy of constitutionally-enshrined rights but, like all fundamental rights, it is not without limitations. (The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 205728, January 21, 2015)

            Political dynasty as provided in the Constitution must be defined by law. Several attempts have been made in Congress to define what is political dynasty but unfortunately until this time the country has no law defining political dynasty.

            The State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption. (Section 27, Article II)     

            It is the policy of the State to promote a high standard of ethics in public service. Public officials and employees shall at all times be accountable to the people and shall discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence, and loyalty, act with patriotism and justice, lead modest lives, and uphold public interest over personal interest. (Section 2, Republic Act No. 6713)

            Honesty and integrity are important traits required of those in public service. If all decisions by quasi-judicial bodies modifying the penalty of dismissal were allowed to become final and unappealable, it would, in effect, show tolerance to conduct unbecoming of a public servant. The quality of civil service would erode, and the citizens would end up suffering for it. (Sambajon v. Public Attorney's Office, G.R. No. 197745, September 6, 2017) 

            Assumption of public office is impressed with the paramount public interest that requires the highest standards of ethical conduct. A person aspiring for public office must obeserve honesty, candor, and faithful compliance with the law. Nothing less is expected. (Catipon v. Japson, G.R. No. 191787, June 22 2015)

            Under the Civil Service Law and its implementing rules, dishonesty, grave misconduct and conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service are graves offenses punishable by dismissal from the service. Thus, as provided law, there is no other penalty that should be imposed on respondent than the penalty of dismissal. (Civil Service Commission v. Cortez, G.R. No. 155732, June 3, 2004)

            Dishonesty is a malevolent act that has no place in the court system. In the present case, respondent's misconduct constitutes grave dishonesty that disqualifies her from holding any position in the judiciary. Her action is a blatant disregard for the values of integrity, uprightness and good conduct which are expected of all court personnel without exception. The behavior of even minor employees mirrors the image of the courts they serve, thus, they should at all times preserve the judiciary's good name and standing as a true temple of justice.

            """<b>Policy of Public Disclosure</b>   
            Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest. (Section 28, Article II)     

            The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. (Section 7, Article III)

            The constitutional guarantee of the right to information on matters of public concern enunciated in Section 7 of Article III of the 1987 Constitution complements the State's policy of full public disclosure in all transactions involving public interest expressed in Section 28 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution. These provisions are aimed at ensuring transparency in policy-making as well as in the operations of the Government, and at safeguarding the exercise by the people of the freedom of expression. In a democratic society like ours, the free exchange of information is necessary and can be possible only if the people are provided the proper information on matters that affect them. But the people's right to information is not absolute. According to Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission, the constitutional guarantee to information "does not open every door to any and all information." It is limited to matters of public concern and is subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. Likewise, the State's policy of full public disclosure is restricted to transactions involving public interest and is further subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law. (Sereno v. Committee on Trade and Related Matters, G.R. No. 175210, February 1, 2016)

            Intended as a "splendid symmetry" to the right to information under the Bill of Rights is the policy of public disclosure under Section 28, Article II of the Constitution. The policy of full public disclosure enunciated in above-quoted Section 28 complements the right of access to information on matters of public concern found in the Bill of Rights. The right to information guarantees the right of the people to demand information, while Section 28 recognizes the duty of officialdom to give information even if nobody demands.

            The policy of public disclosure establishes a concrete ethical principle for the conduct of public affairs in a genuinely open democracy, with the people's right to know as the centerpiece. It is a mandate of the State to be accountable by following such policy. These provisions are vital to the exercise of the freedom of expression and essential to hold public officials at all times accountable to the people. (The Province of North Cotabato v.

        'title': 'Chapter 4 STATE IMMUNITY FROM SUIT',
        'content': [
            """<b>Introduction</b>   
            The State may not be sued without its consent, declares Article XVI, Section 3 of the Constitution.

            The basic postulate enshrined in the Constitution that the State may not be sued without its consent reflects nothing less than a recognition of the sovereign character of the State and an express affirmation of the unwritten rule effectively insulating it from the jurisdiction of courts. It is based on the very essence of sovereignty. As has been aptly observed, by Justice Holmes, a sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends. True, the doctrine, not too infrequently, is derisively called "the royal prerogative of dishonesty" because it grants the state the prerogative to defeat any legitimate claim against it by simply invoking its non-suability. We have had occasion to explain in its defense, however, that a continued adherence to the doctrine of non-suability cannot be deplored, for the loss of governmental efficiency and the obstacle to the performance of its multifarious functions would be far greater in severity than the inconvenience that may be caused private parties, if such fundamental principle is to be abandoned and the availability of judicial remedy is not to be accordingly restricted.

            However, this doctrine of state immunity from suit is not without any limitations. The state may not be sued without its consent is not really absolute for it does not say that the state may not be sued under any circumstance. On the contrary, as correctly phrased, the doctrine only conveys, "the state may not be sued without its consent" its clear import then is that the State may at times be sued. The States' consent may be given either expressly or impliedly. (Republic v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 120385, October 17, 1996)
            """,
            """<b>Reason for Non-suability of the State</b>   
            It is a fundamental postulate of constitutionalism flowing from the juristic concept of sovereignty that the state, as well as its government, is immune from suit unless it gives its consent. It is readily understandable why it must be so. In the classic formulation of Holmes: "A sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends." Sociological jurisprudence supplies an answer not dissimilar. A continued adherence to the doctrine of non-suability is not to be deplored for as against the inconvenience that may be caused private parties, the loss of governmental efficiency and the obstacle to the performance of its multifarious functions are far greater if such a fundamental principle were abandoned and the availability of judicial remedy were not thus restricted. With the well-known propensity on the part of our people to go to court, at the least provocation, the loss of time and energy required to defend against lawsuits, in the absence of such a basic principle that constitutes such an effective obstacle, could very well be imagined."

            """<b>Immunity of Foreign States and Diplomats</b>   
            Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity and a policy held between governments, which ensures that diplomats are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to lawsuits or prosecution under the host country's laws (although they can be expelled). It was agreed as international law in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in 1961, though there is a much longer history in international law. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be customary law. Diplomatic immunity as an institution developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and even armed conflicts. When receiving diplomats formally, representatives of the sovereign (head of state), the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure that they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these will be provided on a reciprocal basis. As one article put it: "So why do we agree to a system in which we're dependent on a foreign country's whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs." (https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203911/http://www. jinnahinstitute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna.convention-accessed date: 6/10/2020)

            A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction, except in the case of (a) a real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving State, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the purposes of the mission; (b) an action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as executor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of the sending State; (c) an action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the diplomatic agent in the receiving State outside his official functions. (Article 31, Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations)

            In Public International Law, when a state or international agency wishes to plead sovereign or diplomatic immunity in a foreign court, it requests the Foreign Office of the state where it is sued to convey to the court that said defendant is entitled to immunity.

            In the Philippines, the practice is for the foreign government or the international organization to first secure an executive endorsement of its claim of sovereign or diplomatic immunity. But how the Philippine Foreign Office conveys its endorsement to the courts varies. In International Catholic Migration Commission v. Calleja, 190 SCRA 130 (1990), the Secretary of Foreign Affairs just sent a letter directly to the Secretary of Labor and Employment, informing the latter that the respondent-employer could not be sued because it enjoyed diplomatic immunity. In World Health Organization v. Aquino, SCRA 242 (1972), the Secretary of Foreign Affairs sent the trial court a telegram to that effect. In Baer v. Tizon, 57 SCRA 1 (1974), the U.S. Embassy asked the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to request the Solicitor General to make, on behalf of the Commander of the United States Naval Base at Olongapo City, Zambales, a "suggestion" to respondent Judge. The Solicitor General embodied the "suggestion" in a Manifestation and Memorandum as amicus curiae. (The Holy See v. Rosario, G.R. No. 101949, December 1, 1994)

            The precept that a State cannot be sued in the courts of a foreign state is a long-standing rule of customary international law then closely identified with the personal immunity of a foreign sovereign from suit and, with the emergence of democratic states, made to attach not just to the person of the head of state, or his representative, but also distinctly to the state itself in its sovereign capacity. If the acts giving rise to a suit are those of a foreign government done by its foreign agent, although not necessarily a diplomatic personage, but acting in his official capacity, the complaint could be barred by the immunity of the foreign sovereign from suit without its consent. Suing a representative of a state is believed to be, in effect, suing the state itself. The proscription is not accorded for the benefit of an individual but for the State, in whose service he is, under the maxim- par in parem, non habet imperium - that all states are sovereign equals and cannot assert jurisdiction over one another. The implication, in broad terms, is that if the judgment against an official would require the state itself to perform an affirmative act to satisfy the award, such as the appropriation of the amount needed to pay the damages decreed against him, the suit must be regarded as being against the state itself, although it has not been formally impleaded.

            In the same case, we also mentioned that in the case of diplomatic immunity, the privilege is not an immunity from the observance of the law of the territorial sovereign or from ensuing legal liability; it is, rather, an immunity from the exercise of territorial jurisdiction.

            """<b>The Principle of Par In Parem Non Habet Imperium</b>   
            Par in parem non habet imperium is a Latin principle which means "equals have no sovereignty over each other." This general principle of international law is one of the bases of state immunity. In the eyes of international law, all sovereigns are equal. As such if the Philippine state has immunity from suit in the local courts, the same immunity also applies to all other states. 

            The Supreme Court ruled that International law is founded largely upon the principles of reciprocity, comity, independence, and equality of States which were adopted as part of the law of our land under Article II, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution. The rule that a State may not be sued without its consent is a necessary consequence of the principles of independence and equality of States. The practical justification for the doctrine of sovereign immunity is that there can be no legal right against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends. In the case of foreign States, the rule is derived from the principle of the sovereign equality of States, as expressed in the maxim par in parem non habet imperium. All another. A contrary attitude would "unduly vex the peace of nations," states are sovereign equals and cannot assert jurisdiction over ons The rules of International Law, however, are neither unyielding r impervious to change. The increasing need of sovereign States to enter into purely commercial activities remotely connected with the discharge of their governmental functions brought about a new holds that the immunity of the sovereign is recognized only with concept of sovereign immunity. This concept, the restrictive theory, regard to public acts or acts jure imperii, but not with regard to private acts or acts jure gestionis. (The Republic of Indonesia Vinzon, G.R.

            """<b>The Vatican Is Immune from Suit</b>   
            The Lateran Treaty established the statehood of the Vatican City "for the purpose of assuring to the Holy See absolute and visible independence and of guaranteeing to it indisputable sovereignty also in the field of international relations." In view of the wordings of the Lateran Treaty, it is difficult to determine whether the statehood is vested in the Holy See or in the Vatican City. Some writers even suggested that the treaty created two international persons - the Holy See and Vatican City.

            The Vatican City fits into none of the established categories of states, and the attribution to it of "sovereignty" must be made in a sense different from that in which it is applied to other states. In a community of national states, the Vatican City represents an entity organized not for political but for ecclesiastical purposes and international objects. Despite its size and object, the Vatican City has an independent government of its own, with the Pope, who is also head of the Roman Catholic Church, as the Holy See or Head of State, in conformity with its traditions, and the demands of its mission in the world. Indeed, the worldwide interests and activities of the Vatican City are such as to make it in a sense an "international state." One authority wrote that the recognition of the Vatican City as a state has significant implication - that, it is possible for any entity pursuing objects essentially different from those pursued by states to be invested with international personality. In as much as the Pope prefers to conduct foreign relations and enter into transactions as the Holy See and not in the name of the Vatican City, one can conclude that in the Pope's own view, it is the Holy See that is the international person.

            The Republic of the Philippines has accorded the Holy See the status of a foreign sovereign. The Holy See, through its Ambassador, the Papal Nuncio, has had diplomatic representations with the Philippine government since 1957. This appears to be the universal practice in international relations. (The Holy See u. Rosario, G.R. No. 101949, December 1, 1994)

            One of the basic immunities of an international organization is immunity from local jurisdiction, i.e., that it is immune from the legal writs and processes issued by the tribunals of the country where it is found. The obvious reason for this is that the subjection of such an organization to the authority of the local courts would afford a convenient medium through which the host government may interfere in their operations or even influence or control its policies and decisions of the organization; besides, such subjection to local jurisdiction would impair the capacity of such body to discharge its responsibilities impartially on behalf of its member- states. (Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center-Aquaculture Department v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 86773, February 14, 1992)

            The grant of immunity from local jurisdiction to International Rice Research Institute is clearly necessitated by their international character and respective purposes. The objective is to avoid the danger of partiality and interference by the host country in their internal workings. The exercise of jurisdiction by the Department of Labor in these instances would defeat the very purpose of immunity, which is to shield the affairs of international organizations, in accordance with international practice, from political pressure or control by the host country to the prejudice of member States of the organization, and to ensure the unhampered performance of their functions. The grant of immunity to IRRI is clear and unequivocal and an express waiver by its Director-General is the only way by which it may relinquish or abandon this immunity. (Callado v.

            The old monarchs of divine origin assumed that they could not do wrong and, therefore, they were placed beyond the pale of the law. They were the law themselves. The dictators, such human specimens as Hitler, Mussolini, the Japanese Emperor, had the crazedness of placing themselves above the law, and humanity felt the overwhelming scourge of such bathismal madness or perversity.

            The rule, therefore, is if the government agency is unincorporated, it is immune from suit while if the government agency is incorporated it may be sued based on other circumstances such as provisions in its charter or the nature of its functions.

            """<b>Incorporated Government Agencies</b>   
            Municipal corporations, for example, like provinces and cities, are agencies of the State when they are engaged in governmental functions and therefore should enjoy the sovereign immunity from suit. Nevertheless, they are subject to suit even in the performance of such functions because their charter provided that they can sue and be sued.            

            It has already been remarked that municipal corporations are suable because their charters grant them the competence to sue and be sued. Nevertheless, they are generally not liable for torts committed by them in the discharge of governmental functions and can be held answerable only if it can be shown that they were acting in a proprietary capacity. In permitting such entities to be sued, the State merely gives the claimant the right to show that the defendant was not acting in its governmental capacity when the injury was committed or that the case comes under the exceptions recognized by law. Failing this, the claimant cannot recover. (Cruz, Philippine Political Law, 1987)

            Indubitably, the National Irrigation Administration is a government corporation with juridical personality and not a mere agency of the government. Since it is a corporate body performing non-governmental functions, it now becomes liable for the damage caused by the accident resulting from the tortious act of its driver- employee. In this particular case, the NIA assumes the responsibility of an ordinary employer and as such, it becomes answerable for damages. This assumption of liability, however, is predicated upon the existence of negligence on the part of respondent NIA. The negligence referred to here is the negligence of supervision. At this juncture, the matter of due diligence on the part of respondent NIA becomes a crucial issue in determining its liability since it has been established that respondent is a government agency performing proprietary functions and as such, it assumes the posture of an ordinary employer which, under Paragraph 5 of Article 2180, is responsible for the damages caused by its employees provided that it has failed to observe or exercise due diligence in the selection and supervision of the driver.

            An "unincorporated agency of the government" can validly invoke the defense of immunity from suit because it has not consented, either expressly or impliedly, to be sued. Significantly, the Department of Health is an unincorporated agency which performs functions of governmental character. An unincorporated government agency without any separate juridical personality of its own enjoys immunity from suit because it is invested with an inherent power of sovereignty. Accordingly, a claim for damages against the agency cannot prosper; otherwise, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is violated. However, the need to distinguish between an unincorporated government agency performing governmental function and one performing proprietary functions has arisen. The immunity has been upheld in favor of the former because its function is governmental or incidental to such function; it has not been upheld in favor of the latter whose function was not in pursuit of a necessary function of government but was essentially a business. (Department of Health v. Phil Pharma Wealth, Inc., G.R No. 182358, February 20, 2013)

            As an unincorporated government agency without any separate juridical personality of its own, the Bureau of Customs enjoys immunity from suit. Along with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, it is invested with an inherent power of sovereignty, namely, taxation. As an agency, the Bureau of Customs performs the governmental function of collecting revenues which is definitely not a proprietary function. (Farolan v. Court of Tax Appeals, G.R.

            The doctrine of state immunity from suit applies to complaints filed against public officials for acts done in the performance of their duties. The rule is that the suit must be regarded as one against the state where satisfaction of the judgment against the public official concerned will require the state itself to perform a positive act, such as appropriation of the amount necessary to pay the damages awarded to the plaintiff.

            The rule does not apply where the public official is charged in his official capacity for acts that are unlawful and injurious to the rights of others. Public officials are not exempt, in their personal capacity, from liability arising from acts committed in bad faith. Neither does it apply where the public official is clearly being sued not in his official capacity but in his personal capacity, although the acts complained of may have been committed while he occupied a public position.

            It is stressed at the outset that the mere allegation that a government functionary is being sued in his personal capacity will not automatically remove him from the protection of the law of public officers and, if appropriate, the doctrine of state immunity. By the same token, the mere invocation of official character will not suffice to insulate him from suability and liability for an act imputed to him as a personal tort committed without or in excess of his authority. These well-settled principles are applicable not only to the officers of the local state but also where the person sued in its courts pertains to the government of a foreign state, as in the present case.

It is clear that a public officer may be sued as such to compel him to do an act required by law, as where, say, a register of deeds refuses to record a deed of sale; or to restrain a Cabinet member, for example, from enforcing a law claimed to be unconstitutional; or to compel the national treasurer to pay damages from an already appropriated assurance fund; or the commissioner of internal revenue to refund tax over-payments from a fund already available for the purpose; or, in general, to secure a judgment that the officer impleaded may satisfy by himself without the government itself having to do a positive act to assist him. We have also held that where the government itself has violated its own laws, the aggrieved party may directly implead the government even without first filing his claim with the Commission on Audit as normally required, as the doctrine of state immunity "cannot be used as an instrument for perpetrating an injustice." (Sanders v. Veridiano, G.R. No. L-46930, June 10, 1988)

            The general rule is that public officials can be held personally accountable for acts claimed to have been performed in connection with official duties where they have acted ultra vires or where there is showing of bad faith. A mere invocation of the immunity clause does not ipso facto result in the charges being automatically dropped. Immunity from suit cannot institutionalize irresponsibility and non- accountability nor grant a privileged status not claimed by any other official of the Republic. Where the petitioner exceeds his authority as Solicitor General, acts in bad faith, or, as contended by the private respondent, 'maliciously conspires with the PCGG commissioners in persecuting respondent Enrile by filing against him an evidently baseless suit in derogation of the latter's constitutional rights and liberties,' there can be no question that a complaint for damages does not confer a license to persecute or recklessly injure another. The actions governed by Articles 19, 20, 21, and 32 of the Civil Code on Human Relations may be taken against public officers or private citizens alike. (Wylie v. Rarang, G.R. No. 74135, May 28, 1992)

            """<b>When the Suit Is Deemed against the State</b>   
            Some instances when a suit against the State is proper are: (1) When the Republic is sued by name; (2) When the suit is against an unincorporated government agency; (3) When the suit is on its face against a government officer but the case is such that ultimate liability will belong not to the officer but to the government.

            While the Republic in this case is sued by name, the ultimate liability does not pertain to the government. Although the military officers and personnel, then party defendants, were discharging their official functions when the incident occurred, their functions ceased to be official the moment they exceeded their authority. Based on the Commission findings, there was lack of justification by the government forces in the use of firearms. Moreover, the members of the police and military crowd dispersal units committed a prohibited act under Batas Pambansa Blg. 880 as there was unnecessary firing by them in dispersing the marchers.

            """<b>Consent by the State to Be Sued</b>  
            As a general rule, a state may not be sued. However, if it consents, or impliedly, then it may be the subject of a suit. either expressly There is express consent when a law, either special or general, so provides. On the other hand, there is implied consent when the state "enters into a contract or it itself commences litigation." However, it must be clarified that when a state enters into a contract, it does not automatically mean that it has waived its non-suability. The State "will be deemed to have impliedly waived its non-suability only if it has entered into a contract in its proprietary or private capacity. However, when the contract involves its sovereign or governmental capacity, no such waiver may be implied." "Statutory provisions waiving state immunity are construed in strictissimi juris. For, waiver of immunity is in derogation of sovereignty." (Department of Health v. Phil Pharma Wealth, Inc., G.R. No. 182358, February 20, 2013)

            The State may not be sued without its consent. This fundamental doctrine stems from the principle that there can be no legal right against the authority which makes the law on which the right depends. This generally accepted principle of law has been explicitly expressed in both the 1973 and the present Constitutions. But as the principle itself implies, the doctrine of state immunity is not absolute. The State may waive its cloak of immunity and the waiver may be made expressly or by implication.

            Over the years, the State's participation in economic and commercial activities gradually expanded beyond its sovereign function as regulator and governor. The evolution of the State's activities and degree of participation in commerce demanded a parallel evolution in the traditional rule of state immunity. Thus, it became necessary to distinguish between the State's sovereign and governmental acts (jure imperii) and its private, commercial, and proprietary acts (jure gestionis). Presently, state immunity restrictively extends only to acts jure imperii while acts jure gestionis are considered as a waiver of immunity. (Department of Transportation and Communications v. Spouses Abecina, G.R. No. 206484, June 29, 2016)

            There is express consent when a law, either special or general, so provides. 

            Express consent may be made through a general law or a special law. In this jurisdiction, the general law waiving the immunity of the state from suit is found in Act No. 3083, where the Philippine government consents and submits to be sued upon any money claim involving liability arising from contract, express or implied, which could serve as a basis of civil actions between private parties. (Republic u. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R No. 120385, October 17, 1996)

            Express consent is effected only by the will of the legislature through the medium of a duly enacted statute. This may be embodied either in a general law or a special law.

            In a general law, the consent is given in a law which authorizes any person who meets the conditions stated in the law to sue the government in accordance with the procedure laid down in the said law. A good example is Act No. 3083 which is known as "An Act Defining the Conditions under which the Government of the Philippines may be Sued." Under this law, the Philippine government consents and submits to be sued upon any money claim involving liability arising from contract, express or implied, which could serve as a basis of civil actions between private parties.

            Moreover, under Article 2189 of the Civil Code, provinces, cities, and municipalities shall be liable for damages for the death or injuries suffered by any person by reason of the defective conditions of roads, streets, public buildings, and other public works under their control and supervision. Also under Article 2180(6) of the Civil Code, referring to vicarious liability, the government is only liable for the acts of its agents, officers, and employees, when they act as special agents.

            A Special Agent is one who receives a definite and fixed order or commission, foreign to the exercise of the duties of his office if he is a special official. (Merritt v. Government of the Philippine Islands, G.R. No. L-11154, March 21, 1916)

            Under a special law consent to be sued may come in the form of a private bill authorizing a named individual to bring suit on a special claim. A special law was passed to enable a person to sue the government for an alleged tort. (see United States v. Guinto, G.R. No. 76607, February 26, 1990)

            The consent of the State to be sued must emanate from statutory authority. Waiver of State immunity can only be made by an act of the legislative body. (Republic V. Feliciano, G.R. No. 70853, March 12, 1987)

In this situation, the government is deemed to have descended to the level of the other contracting party and to have divested itself of its sovereign immunity. This rule, is not, however, without qualification. Not all contracts entered into by the government operate as a waiver of its non-suability; distinction must still be made between one which is executed in the exercise of its sovereign function and another which is done in its proprietary capacity. (Department of Health v. Phil Pharma Wealth, Inc., G.R. No. 182358, February 20, 2013)

            Implied consent, on the other, is given when the State itself commences litigation, thus opening itself to a counter-claim or when it enters into a contract. When the state files complaint, suability will result only where the government is claiming affirmative relief from the defendant. (United States v. Guinto, G.R. No. 76607, February 26, 1990)

            Implied consent is also manifested when it would be inequitable for the State to invoke its immunity, and in instances when the State takes private property for public use or purpose in the exercise of its power of eminent domain. Implied consent is conceded when the State itself commences limitation, thus opening itself to a counter- claim, or when it enters into a contract. (Republic v. NLRC, G.R.

The immunity of the state from suits does not deprive it of the right to sue private parties in its own courts. The state as plaintiff may avail itself of the different forms of actions open to private litigants. In short, by taking the initiative in an action against a private party, the state surrenders its privileged position and comes down to the level of the defendant.

            There are two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each widely held and firmly established. According to the classical or absolute theory, a sovereign cannot, without its consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign. According to the newer or restrictive theory, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized only with regard to public acts or acts jure imperii of a state, but not with regard to private acts or acts jure gestionis.

Certainly, the mere entering into a contract by a foreign state with a private party cannot be the ultimate test. Such an act can only be the start of the inquiry. The logical question is whether the foreign state is engaged in the activity in the regular course of business. If the foreign state is not engaged regularly in a business or trade, the particular act or transaction must then be tested by its nature. If the act is in pursuit of a sovereign activity, or an incident thereof, then it is an act jure imperii, especially when it is not undertaken for gain or profit.

            On the other hand, the Supreme Court has considered the following transactions by a foreign state with private parties as acts jure gestionis: 1) the hiring of a cook in the recreation center, consisting of three restaurants, a cafeteria, a bakery, a store, and a coffee and pastry shop at the John Hay Air Station in Baguio Angeles City. The operation of the restaurants and other facilities open to the general public is undoubtedly for profit as a commercial and not a governmental activity. By entering into the employment United States government impliedly divested itself of its sovereign contract with the cook in the discharge of its proprietary function, the immunity from suit.

            Suability does not necessarily mean liability on the part of the particular instrumentality or agency of the government. When the State gives its consent to be sued, it does not thereby necessarily consent to an unrestrained execution against it. Tersely put, when the State waives its immunity, all it does, in effect, is to give the other party an opportunity to prove, if it can, that the State has a liability. (Republic v. NLRC, October 17, 1996)

            A distinction should first be made between suability and liability. Suability depends on the consent of the state to be sued, liability on the applicable law and the established facts. The circumstance that a state is suable does not necessarily mean that it is liable; on the other hand, it can never be held liable if it does not first consent to be sued. Liability is not conceded by the mere fact that the state has allowed itself to be sued. When the state does waive its sovereign immunity, it is only giving the plaintiff the chance to prove, if it can, that the defendant is liable.

            Well settled is the rule that public funds are not subject to levy and execution. The reason for this was explained in the case of Municipality of Paoay v. Manaois, 86 Phil. 629, "that they are held in trust for the people, intended and used for the accomplishment of the purposes for which municipal corporations are created, and that to subject said properties and public funds to execution would materially impede, even defeat and in some instances destroy said purpose." And, in Tantoco v. Municipal Council of Iloilo, 49 Phil. 52, it was held that "it is the settled doctrine of the law that not only the public property but also the taxes and public revenues of such corporations cannot be seized under execution against them, either in the treasury or when in transit to it. Judgments rendered for taxes, and the proceeds of such judgments in the hands of officers of the law, are not subject to execution unless so declared by statute." Thus, it is clear that all the funds of petitioner municipality in the possession of the Municipal Treasurer of San Miguel, as well as those in the possession of the Provincial Treasurer of Bulacan, are also public funds and as such they are exempt from execution.

If there were an observance of procedural regularity, petitioners would not be in the sad plaint they are now. It is unthinkable then that precisely because there was a failure to abide by what the law requires, the government would stand to benefit. It is just as important, if not more so, that there be fidelity to legal norms on the part of officialdom if the rule of law were to be maintained. It is not too much to say that when the government takes any property for public use, which is conditioned upon the payment of just compensation, to be judicially ascertained, it makes manifest that it submits to the jurisdiction of a court. There is no thought then that the doctrine of immunity from suit could still be appropriately invoked. (Ministerio v. The Court of First Instance of Cebu, G.R. No. L-31635, August 31, 1971)

            The 1987 Constitution outlined the three branches of the government with their corresponding powers and inherent limitations on such powers. Article VI outlines the extent of the powers of Congress, Article VII delineates the powers of the Executive branch while the powers of the Judicial branch are defined and limited by Article VIII.
            """,
            """<b>Separation of Powers</b>
            "Good fences make good neighbors," declares Robert Frost in his 1914 poem Mending Walls. Even Benjamin Franklin is known to have said, "love thy neighbor, yet don't pull down your hedge." This could be the foundation of the concept of separation of powers among the great branches of the government.

            Separation of powers is founded on the belief that, by establishing equilibrium among the three power holders, harmony will result, power will not be concentrated and thus tyranny will be avoided. (Bernas, The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines)

            The president is the head of the executive branch, a co-equal of the judiciary under the Constitution. His or her prerogative is entitled to respect from other branches of government. Inter-branch courtesy is but a consequence of the doctrine of separation of powers. As such, the president cannot be charged with any suit, civil or criminal in nature, during his or her incumbency in office. This is in line with the doctrine of the president's immunity from suit.

            In connection with acts of administrative agencies, ripeness is ensured under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Courts may only take cognizance of a case or controversy if the petitioner has exhausted all remedies available to it under the law. The doctrine ensures that the administrative agency exercised its power to its full extent, including its authority to correct or reconsider its actions. It would, thus, be premature for courts to take cognizance of the case prior to the exhaustion of remedies, not to mention it would violate the principle of separation of powers. Thus, in Rule 65 petitions, it is required that no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy is available to the party. (Kilusang Mayo Uno v. Aquino, III, G.R. No. 210500, April 2, 2019)

            The separation of powers is a fundamental principle in our system of government. It obtains not through express provision but by actual division in our Constitution. Each department of the government has exclusive cognizance of matters within its jurisdiction and is supreme within its own sphere. But it does not follow from the fact that the three powers are to be kept separate and distinct that the Constitution intended them to be absolutely unrestrained and independent of each other. The Constitution has provided for an elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings of the various departments of the government. The government established by the Constitution follows fundamentally the theory of separation of power into the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. (Angara v. Electoral Commission, G.R. No. L-45081, July 15,1936)

            Separation of powers is not expressly provided for in the Constitution. But it obtains from actual division found in Section 1 of Articles VI, VII, VIII, where the three great powers of the government are laid down. The principle of separation of powers ordains that each of the three great branches of government has exclusive cognizance of and is supreme in matters falling within its own constitutionally allocated sphere. Constitutional respect and a becoming regard for she sovereign acts, of a coequal branch prevent this Court from prying into the internal workings of the Senate. Where no provision of the Constitution or the laws or even the Rules of the Senate is clearly shown to have been violated, disregarded, or overlooked, grave abuse of discretion cannot be imputed to Senate officials for acts done within their competence and authority. This Court will be neither a tyrant nor a wimp; rather, it will remain steadfast and judicious in upholding the rule and majesty of the law. (Santiago v. Guingona, G.R. No. 134577, November 18, 1998)

            """<b>Checks and Balances</b> 
            The Constitution has provided for an elaborate system of various departments of the government. And the judiciary in turn, with the Supreme Court as the final arbiter, effectively checks the other departments in the exercise of its power to determine the law, and hence to declare executive and legislative acts void if violative of the Constitution.

            As correctly pointed out by the respondents, the allocation of power in the three principal branches of government is a grant of all powers inherent in them. The President's power to conduct investigations to aid him in ensuring the faithful execution of laws in this case, fundamental laws on public accountability and transparency is inherent in the President's powers as the Chief Executive. That the authority of the President to conduct investigations and to create bodies to execute this power is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution or in statutes does not mean that he is bereft of such authority. As explained in the landmark case of Marcos u. Manglapus: x x x. The 1987 Constitution, however, brought back the presidential system of government and restored the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers by their actual distribution among three distinct branches of with provision for checks and balances. (Biraogo v. The Philippine government Truth Commission, G.R. No. 192935, December 7, 2010)

            Despite the separation of the powers vested by the Constitution in these three distinct branches of the national government, it does not follow that the three powers are to be kept separate and distinct and absolutely unrestrained and absolutely independent and at odds with each other. The Constitution has provided for an elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings of the various departments of the government. For example, the Chief Executive under our Constitution is so far made a check on the legislative power that this assent is required in the enactment of laws. This, however, is subject to the further check that a bill may become a law notwithstanding the refusal of the President to approve it, by a vote of two-thirds or three-fourths, as the case may be, of the National Assembly.

            The President has also the right to convene the Assembly in special session whenever he chooses. On the other hand, the National Assembly operates as a check on the Executive in the sense that its consent through its Commission on Appointments is necessary in the appointments of certain officers; and the concurrence of a majority of all its members is essential to the conclusion of treaties. Furthermore, in its power to determine what courts other than the Supreme Court shall be established, to define their jurisdiction and to appropriate funds for their support, the National Assembly controls the judicial department to a certain extent. The Assembly also exercises the judicial power of trying impeachments. And the judiciary in turn, with the Supreme Court as the final arbiter, effectively checks the other departments in the exercise of its power to determine the law, and hence to declare executive and legislative acts void if violate[sic] of the Constitution.

            """<b>Delegation of Powers</b>  
            Delegata potestas non potest delegari is a Latin phrase which states that "no delegated powers can be further delegated. "It is also known as delegatus non potest delegare which means "one to whom power is delegated cannot himself further delegate that power."

            In other words, the one who has the power or authority delegated from another to do an act must do it himself/herself as this is a trust or confidence reposed in that person personally and cannot let anyone do it on his behalf.

            Since the powers of the government have been delegated to them by the people, who possess original sovereignty, these powers cannot be further delegated by the different departments of the government to some other branch or instrumentality of the government. The principle of non-delegation of powers is usually applied to legislative power. Since the legislative power of Congress is already a delegated power given to them by the people particularly Section 1, Article VI of the Constitution, Congress cannot pass laws delegating such power to some other departments, branches, or instrumentalities of the government.

            As expressed in the Latin maxim potestas delegata non delegari potest, which means "what has been delegated, cannot be delegated." This doctrine is based on the ethical principle that such delegated power constitutes not only a right but a duty to be performed by the delegate through the instrumentality of his own judgment and Employees Association v. Teves, G.R. No. 181704, December 6, 2011)

            The principle of non-delegation of powers is applicable to all the three major powers of the Government but is especially important in its delegation is permitted. The occasions are rare when executive or the case of the legislative power because of the many instances when judicial powers have to be delegated by the authorities to which they legally certain. In the case of the legislative power, however, such occasions have become more and more frequent, if not necessary. This had led to the observation that the delegation of legislative power has become the rule and its non-delegation the exception. (Eastern Shipping Lines v. Philippine Overseas Employment Administration G.R. No. 76633, October 18, 1988)

            It is a general principle of law, expressed in the maxim "delegatus non potest delegare," that a delegated power may not be further delegated by the person to whom such power is delegated and that in all cases of delegated authority, where personal trust or confidence is reposed in the agent and especially where the exercise and application of the power is made subject to his judgment or discretion, the authority is purely personal and cannot be delegated to another unless there is a special power of substitution either express or necessarily implied.

            """<b>Exceptions to Non-delegation Rule</b>
            The general rule on non-delegation, however, has known exceptions in our laws and jurisprudence, to wit:

            1. Powers reserve to the people by the provision on initiative and referendum found in Section 1, Article VI of the Constitution.

            2. Emergency power delegated to the Executive during a State of War or National Emergency based on Section 23, Article VI of the Constitution.

            3. Certain taxing powers of the President. The Congress may authorize the President to fix, within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government. (Article VI, Section 28[2])

            4. Subordinate legislation made by administrative agencies under the theory in Administrative Law that what is delegated is administrative agencies have the power to "fill up the details" of a statute passed by Congress in the course of its implementation.

            5. Legislative power delegated to local government units. Local governments may be allowed to legislate on purely local matters. (Rubi v. Provincial Board of Mindoro, G.R. No. L-14078, March 7, 1919)

            It is contended that the royalty rates prescribed in the Cabinet resolution are not fees but in effect partake of the nature of an ad valorem tax the imposition of which cannot be delegated to the President by Congress. The rule which forbids delegation of legislative power is not absolute. It admits of exceptions as when the Constitution itself authorizes such delegation. (Donnelly and Associates v. Auditor General, G.R. No. L-4510, May 31, 1954)

            """<b>Tests for Valid Delegation</b> 
            Jurisprudence provides that although Congress may delegate to another branch of the Government the power to fill in the details in the execution, enforcement, or administration of a law, it is essential, to forestall a violation of the principle of separation of powers, that said law: (a) be complete in itself. The law must set forth therein the policy to be executed, carried out, or implemented by the delegate. This is known as the completeness test; (b) fix a standard or set the limits which are sufficiently determinate or determinable to which the delegate must conform in the performance of his functions. This is known as the sufficient standard test.

            In the face of the increasing complexity of modern life, delegation of legislative power to various specialized administrative agencies is allowed as an exception to this principle. Given the volume and variety of interactions in today's society, it is doubtful if the legislature can promulgate laws that will deal adequately with and respond promptly to the minutiae of everyday life. Hence, the -the principal agencies need to delegate to administrative bodies the authority to tasked to execute laws in their specialized fields - promulgate rules and regulations to implement a given statute and effectuate its policies. All that is required for the valid exercise of this power of subordinate legislation is that the regulation be germane to the objects and purposes of the law and that the regulation be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by the law. These requirements are denominated as the completeness test and the sufficient standard test. (Bureau of Customs Employees Association v. Teves, G.R. No. 181704, December 6, 2011)

            There are two accepted tests to determine whether or not there test and the sufficient standard test. Under the first test, the law is a valid delegation of legislative power, viz., the completeness must be complete in all its terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature such that when it reaches the delegate, the only thing there must be adequate guidelines or stations in the law to map he will have to do is enforce it. Under the sufficient standard test, out the boundaries of the delegate's authority and prevent the delegation from running riot. Both tests are intended to prevent a total transference of legislative authority to the delegate, who is not allowed to step into the shoes of the legislature and exercise a power essentially legislative. (Eastern Shipping Lines v. Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, G.R. No. 76633, October 18, 1988)

            Indeed, without a statutory declaration of policy, the delegate would in effect, make or formulate such policy, which is the essence of every law; and, without the aforementioned standard, there would be no means to determine, with reasonable certainty, whether the delegate has acted within or beyond the scope of his authority. Hence, he could thereby arrogate upon himself the power, not only to make the law, but, also and this is worse to unmake it, by adopting measures inconsistent with the end sought to be attained by the Act of Congress, thus nullifying the principle of separation of powers and the system of checks and balances, and, consequently, undermining the very foundation of our Republican system.

            """<b>Extent of the Power of Congress to Delegate</b>  
            There is neither an express prohibition nor an express grant of authority in the Constitution for Congress to delegate to regional or local legislative bodies the power to create local government units. However, under its plenary legislative powers, Congress can delegate to local legislative bodies the power to create local government units, subject to reasonable standards and provided no conflict arises with any provision of the Constitution. In fact, Congress has delegated to provincial boards, and city and municipal councils, the power to create barangay within their juridiction, subject to compliance with the criteria established in the Local Government Code, and the plebiscite requirement in Section 10, Article X of the Constituon. However, under the Local Government Code, only an Act of Congress can create provinces, cities or municipalities. (Sema v. Comelec, G.R. No. 177597, July 16, 2008)
            """,
            """<b>Blending of Powers</b>
            Our governmental structure rests on the principle of separation of powers. Under our constitutional order, the legislative branch enacts law, the executive branch implements the law and the judiciary construes the law. In reality, however, the powers are not as strictly confined or delineated to each branch. "The growing complexity of modem life, the multiplication of the subjects of governmental regulation, and the increased difficulty of administering the laws" require the delegation of powers traditionally belonging to the legislative to administrative agencies. The legislature may likewise apportion competencies or jurisdictions to administrative agencies over certain conflicts involving special technical expertise. (The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), G.R. No. 202275, July 17, 2018)

            Blending of power is a situation where there is a sharing of two or more departments in the performance of a given constitutional task. One department acts in a manner complementary or supplementary to another. Under our laws and jurisprudence, the general rule is separation of powers and the exceptions are blending of powers and checks and balances.

            Under the Constitution, blending of power happens when different bodies put their powers together to achieve a goal. For example, when the President signs a bill, there is blending between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch. While when the President vetoes a bill, there is check and balance. Moreover, when the Commission on Appointments of Congress confirms the President's appointment, there is blending of powers. And when it does not confirm, there is check and balance.

            The president prepares a budget and Congress enacts an appropriation law pursuant to that budget. The president enters into a treaty with foreign countries and the Senate ratifies the same. The Supreme Court may declare a treaty, international or executive agreement, or law, as unconstitutional, and it has also the to declare invalid any act done by the other departments of power government.

            When the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them. (Biraogo v. Philippine Truth Commission, G.R. No. 192935, December 7, 2010)

            A mingling of powers among the three branches of government is not a novel concept. This blending of powers has become necessary to properly address the complexities brought about by a rapidly developing society and which the traditional branches of government have difficulty coping with.

            The 1987 Constitution mandates that an aspirant for election to the House of Representatives be "a registered voter in the district in which he shall be elected, and a resident thereof for a period of not less than one year immediately preceding the election." The -reproduced verbatim from the 1973 mischief which this provision- Constitution seeks to prevent is the possibility of a "stranger or newcomer unacquainted with the conditions and needs of community and not identified with the latter, from an elective office to serve that community."

            Residence is synonymous with domicile which reveals a tendency or mistakes the concept of domicile for actual residence, a conception not intended for the purpose of determining a candidate's qualifications for the election to the House of Representatives as required by the 1987 Constitution.

            An individual does not lose her domicile even if she has lived and maintained residences in different places. In the case at bench, the evidence adduced by Motejo lacks the degree of persuasiveness as required to convince the court that an abandonment of domicile of origin in favor of a domicile of choice indeed incurred. It cannot be correctly argued that Marcos lost her domicile of origin by operation of law as a result of her marriage to the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos. It can be concluded that the facts supporting its proposition that petitioner was ineligible to run for the position of Representative of the First District of Leyte, the COMELEC was obviously referring to petitioner's various places of (actual) residence, not her domicile.

            Having determined that Marcos possessed the necessary residence qualifications to run for a seat in the House of Representatives in the First District of Leyte, the COMELEC's questioned resolutions dated April 24, May 7, May 11, and May 25 are set aside. Provincial Board of Canvassers is directed to proclaim Marcos as the duly elected Representative of the First District of Leyte. (Imelda Marcos u. Comelec, G.R. No. 119976, September 18, 1995)

            """<b>Resident for Not Less Than One Year</b>
            The Constitution requires that a person seeking election to the House of Representatives should be a resident of the district in which he seeks election for a period of not less than one year prior to the elections. Residence, for election law purposes, has a settled meaning in our jurisdiction. In Co v. Electoral Tribunal "residence" has always been understood as synonymous with of the House of Representatives, this Court held that the term "domicile" not only under the previous Constitutions but also under the 1987 Constitution.

            The framers of the Constitution adhered to the earlier definition given to the word "residence" which regarded it as having the same meaning as domicile.

            Clearly, the place "where a party actually or constructively has his permanent home" where he, no matter where he may be found at any given time, eventually intends to return and remain, i.e., his domicile, is that to which the Constitution refers when it speaks of residence for the purposes of election law. The manifest purpose of this deviation from the usual conceptions of residency in law as explained in Gallego v. Vera is "to exclude strangers or newcomers unfamiliar with the conditions and needs of the community" from taking advantage of favorable circumstances existing in that community for electoral gain.

            While there is nothing wrong with the practice of establishing residence in a given area for meeting election law requirements, this nonetheless defeats the essence of representation, which is to place through the assent of voters those most cognizant and sensitive to the needs of a particular district, if a candidate falls short of the period of residency mandated by law for him to qualify. That purpose could be obviously best met by individuals who have either had actual residence in the area for a given period or who have been domiciled in the same area either by origin or by choice. It would, therefore, be imperative for this Court to inquire into the threshold question as to whether or not petitioner actually was a resident for a period of one year in the area now encompassed by the Second Legislative District of Makati at the time of his election or whether or not he was domiciled in the same.

            As found by the COMELEC en banc petitioner in his Certificate of Candidacy for the May 11, 1992 elections, indicated not only that he was a resident of San Jose, Concepcion, Tarlac in 1992 but that he was a resident of the same for 52 years immediately preceding that election. At the time, his certificate indicated that he was also a registered voter of the same district. His birth certificate places Concepcion, Tarlac as the birthplace of both of his parents Benigno and Aurora. Thus, from data furnished by petitioner himself to the COMELEC at various times during his political career, what stands consistently clear and unassailable is that this domicile of origin of record up to the time of filing of his most recent certificate of candidacy for the 1995 elections was Concepcion, Tarlac.

            While property ownership is not and should never be an i himself claims that he has other residences in Metro Manila coupled of the right to vote or to be voted upon, the fact that petitioner with the short length of time he claims to be a resident of the condominium unit in Makati (and the fact, of his stated domicile in his physical residence" is not to acquire new residence or domicile Tarlac) "indicate that the sole purpose of (petitioner) in transferring "but only to qualify as a candidate for Representative of the Second District of Makati City." The absence of clear and positive proof showing a successful abandonment of domicile under the conditions stated above, the lack of identification sentimental, actual or otherwise with the area, and the suspicious circumstances under which the lease agreement was effected all belie petitioner's claim of residency for the period required by the Constitution, in the Second District of Makati.

            A democratic government is necessarily a government of laws. In a republican government those laws are themselves ordained by the people. Through their representatives, they dictate the qualifications necessary for service in government positions. And as petitioner clearly lacks one of the essential qualifications for running for membership in the House of Representatives, not even the will of a majority or plurality of the voters of the Second District of Makati City would substitute for a requirement mandated by the fundamental law itself.

            Filipino citizens who have lost their citizenship may however reacquire the same in the manner provided by law. Commonwealth Act No. 63, enumerates the three modes by which Philippine citizenship may be reacquired by a former citizen: (1) by naturalization, (2) by repatriation, and (3) by direct act of Congress.

            Moreover, repatriation results in the recovery of the original nationality. This means that a naturalized Filipino who lost his citizenship will be restored to his prior status as a naturalized Filipino citizen. On the other hand, if he was originally a natural- born citizen before he lost his Philippine citizenship, he will be restored to his former status as a natural-born Filipino.

            Having thus taken the required oath of allegiance to the Republic and having registered the same in the Civil Registry of Magantarem, Pangasinan in accordance with the aforecited provision, respondent Cruz is deemed to have recovered his original status as a natural-born citizen, a status which he acquired at birth as the son of a Filipino father. It bears stressing that the act of repatriation allows him to recover, or return to, his original status before he lost his Philippine citizenship. (Bengson v. HRET, G.R. No. 142840, May 7, 2001)

            Legislative apportionment is defined by Black's Law Dictionary as the determination of the number of representatives which a State, county, or other subdivision may send to a legislative body. It is the allocation of seats in a legislative body in proportion to the population; the drawing of voting district lines so as to equalize population and voting power among the districts. (Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, p. 91)

            Under both Article VI, Section 5, and Article X, Section 10 of the Constitution, the authority to act has been vested in the Legislature. The Legislature undertakes the apportionment and reapportionment of legislative districts and likewise acts on local government units by setting the standards for their creation, division, merger, abolition and alteration of boundaries and by actually creating, dividing, merging, abolishing local government units and altering their boundaries through legislation. Other than this, not much commonality exists between the two provisions since they are inherently different although they interface and relate with one another. (Bagabuyo v. Comelec, G.R. No. 176970, December 8, 2008)

            The apportionment of legislative districts must be by law which could be: a) General Apportionment Law or b) Special Law, for example a law creating new provinces, cities or districts.

            Note:
            The power to apportion legislative distrincts is textually committed to Congress by the Constituion. Thus, it cannot be validly delegated to the ARMM Regional Assembly.

            There is neither an express prohibition nor an express grant of authority in the Constitution for Congress to delegate to regional or local legislative bodies the power to create local government units However, under its plenary legislative powers, Congress can delegate to local legislative bodies the power to create local government units subject to reasonable standards and provided no conflict arises with any provision of the Constitution.

            In fact, Congress has delegated to provincial boards, and city and municipal councils, the power to create barangays within their jurisdiction, subject to compliance with the criteria established in the Local Government Code, and the plebiscite requirement in Section 10, Article X of the Constitution. However, under the Local Government Code, "only x x x an Act of Congress" can create provinces, cities or municipalities. (Sema v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 177597, July 16, 2008)

            Under the Constitution and the Local Government Code (Republic Act No. 7160) the apportionment and reapportionment do not require a plebiscite. (Bagabuyo v. Comelec, G.R. No. 176970, December 8, 2008)

            Gerrymandering refers to the act of dividing of a state, or county, etc., into election districts so as to give one political party a majority in many districts while concentrating the voting strength of the other party into as few districts as possible. (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gerrymandering/april092020 date: 4/9/2020)

            The word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the Boston Gazette on March 26, 1812. The word was created in reaction to a redrawing of Massachusetts state senate election districts under Governor Elbridge Gerry. In 1812, Democratic-Republican Party. When mapped, one of the contorted Gerry signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts to benefit his districts in the Boston area was said to resemble the shape of a mythological salamander.

            The provision draws a plain and clear distinction between the entitlement of a city to a district on one hand, and the entitlement of a province to a district on the other. For while a province is entitled to at least a representative, with nothing mentioned about population, a city must first meet a population minimum of 250,000 in order to be similarly entitled.

            The use by the subject provision of a comma to separate the phrase "each city with a population of at least two hundred fifty thousand" from the phrase "or each province" point to no other conclusion than that the 250,000 minimum population is only required for a city, but not for a province. Plainly read, Section 5(3) of the Constitution requires a 250,000 minimum population only for a city to be entitled to a representative, but not so for a province.

            Our ruling is that population is not the only factor but is just one of several other factors in the composition of the additional district. Such settlement is in accord with both the text of the Constitution and the spirit of the letter, so very clearly given form in the Constitutional debates on the exact issue presented by this petition.

            Second, <b>the two percent threshold</b> - only those parties garnering a minimum of two percent of the total valid votes cast for the party-list system are "qualified" to have a seat in the House of Representatives;

            Third, <b>the three-seat limit</b> - each qualified party, regardless of the number of votes it actually obtained, is entitled to a maximum of three seats; that is, one "qualifying" and two additional seats. Fourth, proportional representation the additional seats which a qualified party is entitled to, shall be computed "in proportion to their total number of votes."

            Fourth, <b>proportional representation</b> - the additional seats which a qualified party is entitled to, shall be computed "in proportion to their total number of votes."

            Because the Comelec violated these legal parameters, the assailed Resolutions must be struck down for having been issued in grave abuse of discretion. The poll body is mandated to enforce and administer election-related laws. It has no power to contravene or amend them.

Its bounden duty is to craft rules, regulations, methods and formulas to implement election laws not to reject, ignore, defeat, obstruct or circumvent them.

            Neither the Constitution nor Republic Act No. 7941 prohibits major political parties from participating in the party-list system. On the contrary, the framers of the Constitution clearly intended the major political parties to participate in party-list elections through their sectoral wings. In fact, the members of the Constitutional Commission voted down, 19-22, any permanent sectoral seats, and in the alternative the reservation of the party-list system to the sectoral groups. In defining a "party" that participates in party-list elections as either "a political party or a sectoral party," Republic Act No. 7941 also clearly intended that major political parties will participate in the party-list elections. Excluding the major political parties in party-list elections is manifestly against the Constitution, the intent of the Constitutional Commission, and Republic Act No. 7941. This Court cannot engage in socio-political engineering and judicially legislate the exclusion of major political parties from the party-list elections in patent violation of the Constitution and the law.

The other major political parties can thus organize, or affiliate with, their chosen sector or sectors. To further illustrate, the Nacionalista Party can establish a fisherfolk wing to participate in the party-list election, and this fisherfolk wing can field i fisherfolk nominees.

            The phrase "marginalized and underrepresented" appears only once in Republic Act No. 7941, in Section 2 on Declaration of Policy.

            Section 2 seeks "to promote proportional representation in the the party-list system," which will enable Filipinos belonging to election of representatives to the House of Representatives through the "marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies," to become members of the House of Representatives. While the policy declaration in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7941 broadly refers to "marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties," the specific implementing provisions of Republic Act No. 7941 do not define or require that the sectors, organizations, or parties must be "marginalized and underrepresented." On the contrary, to even interpret that all the sectors mentioned in Section 5 are "marginalized and underrepresented" would lead to absurdities.

            How then should we harmonize the broad policy declaration in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7941 with its specific implementing provisions, bearing in mind the applicable provisions of the 1987 Constitution on the matter?

            The phrase "marginalized and underrepresented" should refer only to the sectors in Section 5 that are, by their nature, economically "marginalized and underrepresented." These sectors are: labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, handicapped, veterans, overseas workers, and other similar sectors. For these sectors, a majority of the members of the sectoral party must belong to the "marginalized and underrepresented." The nominees of the sectoral party either must belong to the sector or must have a track record of advocacy for the sector represented. Belonging to the "marginalized and underrepresented" sector does not mean one must "wallow in poverty, destitution or infirmity." It is sufficient that one, or his or her sector, is below the middle class. More specifically, the economically "marginalized and underrepresented" are those who fall in the low-income group as classified by the National Statistical Coordination Board.

            The recognition that national and regional parties, as well as sectoral parties of professionals, the elderly, women, and the youth, need not be "marginalized and underrepresented" will I allow small ideology-based and cause-oriented parties who lack "well-defined political constituencies" a chance to win seats in "marginalized and underrepresented" the sectoral parties for labor. peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, handicapped, veterans, overseas workers, and other sectors that by their nature are economically at the margins of society, will give the "marginalized and underrepresented" an opportunity to likewise win seats in the House of Representatives.

            This interpretation will harmonize the 1987 Constitution and Republic Act No. 7941 and will give rise to a multi-party system where those "marginalized and underrepresented," both in economic and ideological status, will have the opportunity to send their own members to the House of Representatives. This interpretation will also make the party-list system honest and transparent, eliminating the need for relatively well-off party-list representatives to masquerade as "wallowing in poverty, destitution and infirmity." even as they attend sessions in Congress riding in SUVs.

            1. Three different groups may participate in the party-list system: (1) national parties or organizations, (2) regional parties or organizations, and (3) sectoral parties or organizations.

            2. National parties or organizations and regional parties or organizations do not need to organize along sectoral lines and do not need to represent any "marginalized and underrepresented" sector.

            3. Political parties can participate in party-list elections provided they register under the party-list system and do not field candidates in legislative district elections. A political party, whether major or not, that fields candidates in legislative district elections can participate in party-list elections only through its sectoral wing that can separately register under the party-list system. The sectoral wing is by itself an independent sectoral party and is linked to a political party through a coalition.

            4. Sectoral parties or organizations may either be "marginalized and underrepresented" or lacking in "well-defined political constituencies." It is enough that their principal advocacy pertains to the special interest and concerns of their sector. The sectors that are "marginalized and underrepresented" include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, handicapped, veterans, and overseas workers. The sectors that lack "well defined political constituences" include professionals, the elderly, woman, and the youth.

            5. A majority of the members of sectoral parties or organizations that represent the "marginalized and underrepresented" sector they represent. Similarly, a majority of the underrepresented" must belong to the "marginalized and members of sectoral parties or organizations that lack "well-defined political constituencies" must belong to the sector they represent. The nominees of s ctoral parties or organizations that represent the "marginalized and underrepresented," or that represent those who lack "well-defined political constituencies," either must belong to their respective sectors, or must have a track record of advocacy for their respective sectors. The nominees of national and regional parties or organizations must be bona fide members of such parties or organizations.

            6. National, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations shall not be disqualified if some of their nominees are disqualified, provided that they have at least one nominee who remains qualified. (Atong Paglaum, Inc. v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 203766, April 2, 2013)

            Our Constitution enshrines parliamentary immunity which is a fundamental privilege cherished in every legislative assembly of the democratic world. As old as the English Parliament, its purpose "is to enable and encourage a representative of the public to discharge his public trust with firmness and success" for "it is indispensably necessary that he should enjoy the fullest liberty of speech, and that he should be protected from the resentment of everyone, however powerful, to whom exercise of that liberty may occasion offense."

            Such immunity has come to this country from the practices of Parliamentary as construed and applied by the Congress of the United States. Its extent and application remain no longer in the legislator complete freedom of expression without fear of being made responsible in criminal or civil actions before the courts or any doubt in so far as related to the question before us. It guarantees other forum outside of the Congressional Hall. But it does not protect him from responsibility before the legislative body itself whenever his words and conduct are considered by the latter disorderly or unbecoming a member thereof.

            For unparliamentary conduct, members of Parliament or of Congress have been, or could be censured, committed to prison, even expelled by the votes of their colleagues. The appendix to this decision amply attests to the consensus of informed opinion regarding the practice and the traditional power of legislative assemblies to take disciplinary action against its members, including imprisonment, suspension or expulsion.

            Incompatibility between two offices is an inconsistency in the functions of the two; x x x Where one office is not subordinate to the other, nor the relations of the one to the other such as are inconsistent and repugnant, there is not that incompatibility from which the law declares that the acceptance of the one is the vacation of the other. The force of the word, in its application to this matter is, that from the nature and relations to each other, of the two places, they ought not to be held by the same person, from the contrariety and antagonism which would result in the attempt by one person to faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of one, toward the incumbent of the other.

            """<b>Effect of Imprisonment</b>  
            The present Constitution adheres to the same restrictive rule minus the obligation of Congress to surrender the subject Congressman to the custody of the law. The requirement that he should be attending sessions or committee meetings has also been removed. For relatively minor offenses, it is enough that Congress is in session.

            The accused-appellant argues that a member of Congress' function to attend sessions is underscored by Section 16(2), Article VI of the Constitution which states that:

            A majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may compel the attendance of absent Members in such manner, and under such penalties, as such House may provide.

            However, the accused-appellant has not given any reason why he should be exempted from the operation of Section 11, Article VI of the Constitution. The members of Congress cannot compel absent members to attend sessions if the reason for the absence is a legitimate one. The confinement of a Congressman charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than six months is not merely authorized by law, it has constitutional foundations.

            A person charged with crime is taken into custody for purposes of the administration of justice. As stated in United States v. Gustilo, 19 Phil. 208, 212, it is the injury to the public which State action in criminal law seeks to redress. It is not the injury to the complainant. After conviction in the Regional Trial Court, the accused may be denied bail and thus subjected to incarceration if there is risk of his absconding.

            The accused-appellant states that the plea of the electorate which voted him into office cannot be supplanted by unfounded fears that he might escape eventual punishment if permitted to perform congressional duties outside his regular place of confinement.

            It will be recalled that when a warrant for accused-appellant's arrest was issued, he fled and evaded capture despite a call from his colleagues in the House of Representatives for him to attend the sessions and to surrender voluntarily to the authorities. Ironically, it is now the same body whose call he initially spurned which accused- appellant is invoking to justify his present motion. This cannot be countenanced because, to reiterate, aside from its being contrary to well-defined Constitutional restraints, it would be a mockery of the aims of the State's penal system. (People v.

            <b>Note:</b>
            The opening of the regular session of Congress is fixed by the Constitution on the fourth Monday of July every year and shall end not later than 30 days before the opening of the next regular session and excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. The opening to the regular session of Congress is also the time when the President delivers his State of the Nation Address (SONA) before the joint session of Congress.

            The SONA serves as an avenue used by the President to inform the nation about its present economic, political, and social condition. It is also a means for the President to broadcast the accomplishments and plans or programs of his/her administration for a particular year and until the end of his/her term of office.

            The Senate shall elect its President and the House of Representatives its Speaker, by a majority vote of all its respective Members. 

            Each House shall choose such other officers as it may deem necessary. (Section 16[1], Article VI)

             The term majority has been judicially defined a number of times. When referring to a certain number out of a total or aggregate, it simply means the number greater than half or more than half of any total. The plain and unambiguous words of the subject constitutional clause simply mean that the Senate President must obtain the votes of more than one-half of all the senators. Not by any construal does it thereby delineates who comprise the majority. much less the minority, in the said body. And there is no showing that the framers of our Constitution had in mind other than the usual meanings of these terms.

             In effect, while the Constitution mandates that the President of the Senate must be elected by a number constituting more than one-half of all the members thereof, it does not provide that the members who will not vote for him shall ipso facto constitute the minority, who could thereby elect the minority leader. Verily, no law or regulation states that the defeated candidate shall automatically become the minority leader. (Santiago v. Guingona, G.R. No. 134577, November 18, 1998)

            Quorum refers to the number of members who must be present at a meeting in order for decisions to be officially made. (https:// dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/quorum/ accessed date: 4/20/2020)

            When the Constitution declares that a majority of "each House" shall constitute a quorum, "the House" does not mean "all" the members. Even a majority of all the members constitute "the House." (Missouri Pac. vs. Kansas, 63 Law ed. [U. S.], p. 239) There is a difference between a majority of "the House," the latter requiring less number than the first. Therefore, an absolute majority (12) of all the members of the Senate less one (23), constitutes constitutional majority of the Senate for the purpose of a quorum. Mr. Justice Pablo believes furthermore than even if the 12 did not constitute a quorum, they could have ordered the arrest of one, at least, of the absent members; if one had been so arrested, there would be no doubt Quorum then, and Senator Cuenco would have been elected just the same in as much as there would be 11 for Cuenco, one against and one abstained.

            The Constitution empowers each house to determine its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations all matters of method are open to the determination of the House, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just. It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The power to make rules is not one which once exercised is exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be exercised by the House, and within the limitations suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal.

            Petitioners must realize that each of the three departments of our government has its separate sphere which the others may not invade without upsetting the delicate balance on which our constitutional order rests. Due regard for the working of our system of government, more than mere comity, compels reluctance on our part to enter upon an inquiry into an alleged violation of the rules of the House.

Under the enrolled bill rule, once an election for the adoption of a statute is held, the procedural method by which the measure was placed on the ballot cannot be challenged with a lawsuit since judicial inquiry into legislative procedure is barred as an intrusion into the internal affairs of the lawmaking body. In addition, this rule enhances the stability of statutory enactments. Citizens can reasonably rely on the legality of filed enactments. As a result, an enrolled bill is the most authoritative source of statutory law in a jurisdiction. (https://legal-dictionary. thefreedictionary.com/Enrolled+Bill-accessed date: 4/20/2020)

No. 7198 by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate and the certification by the secretaries of both Houses of Congress that it was passed on November 21, 1996 are conclusive of its due enactment. Much energy and learning are devoted in the separate opinion of Justice Puno, joined by Justice Davide, to disputing this doctrine. To be sure, there is no claim either here or in the decision in the EVAT cases [Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance] that the enrolled bill embodies a conclusive presumption. In one case we "went behind" an enrolled bill and consulted the Journal to determine whether certain provisions of a statute had been approved by the Senate. (Arroyo u. De Venecia, G.R.

The senior Justice in the Election Tribunal shall be its Chairman.

            It seems quite clear to us that in thus providing for a Tribunal to be staffed by both Justices of the Supreme Court and Members of the Senate, the Constitution intended that both those judicial and 'legislative' components commonly share the duty and authority of deciding all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of Senators. The respondent Tribunal correctly stated one part of this proposition when it held that said provision"... is shall be a clear expression of an intent that all (such) contests... resolved by a panel or body in which their (the Senators') peers in that Chamber are represented." The other part, of course, is that the constitutional provision just as clearly mandates the participation in the same process of decision of a representative or representatives of the Supreme Court.

            Said intent is even more clearly signaled by the fact that the proportion of Senators to Justices in the prescribed membership of the Senate Electoral Tribunal is 2 to 1- an unmistakable indication that the "legislative component" cannot be totally excluded from participation in the resolution of senatorial election contests, without doing violence to the spirit and intent of the Constitution.

            Where, as here, a situation is created which precludes the substitution of any Senator sitting in the Tribunal by any of his other colleagues in the Senate without inviting the same objections to the substitute's competence, the proposed mass disqualification, if sanctioned and ordered, would leave the Tribunal no alternative but to abandon a duty that no other court or body can perform, but which it cannot lawfully discharge if shorn of the participation of its entire membership of Senators.

             May the House of Representatives, at the request of the dominant political party therein, change that party's representation in the House Electoral Tribunal to thwart the promulgation of a decision freely reached by the tribunal in an election contest pending therein? May the Supreme Court review and annul that action of the House?

             The independence of the House Electoral Tribunal so zealously guarded by the framers of our Constitution, would, however, by a myth and its proceedings a farce if the House of Representatives, or the majority party therein, may shuffle and manipulate the political (as distinguished from the judicial) component of the electoral tribunal, to serve the interests of the party in power.

             Members of the HRET as "sole judge" of congressional election contests are entitled to security of tenure just as members of the judiciary enjoy security of tenure under our Constitution. (Section 2. Article VIII, 1987 Constitution) Therefore, membership in the House Electoral Tribunal may not be terminated except for a just cause, such as, the expiration of the member's congressional term of office, his death, permanent disability, resignation from the political party he represents in the tribunal, formal affiliation with another political party, or removal for other valid cause. A member may not be expelled by the House of Representatives for "party disloyalty" short of proof that he has formally affiliated with another political group. As the records of this case fail to show that Congressman Camasura has become a registered member of another political party, his expulsion from the LDP and from the HRET was not for a valid cause, hence, violated his right to security of tenure.

             The judicial power of this Court has been invoked by Bondoc for the protection of his rights against the strong arm of the majority party in the House of Representatives. The Court cannot be deaf to his plea for relief, nor indifferent to his charge that the House of Representatives had acted with grave abuse of discretion in removing Congressman Camasura from the House Electoral Tribunal. He calls upon the Court, as guardian of the Constitution, to exercise its judicial power and discharge its duty to protect his rights as the party aggrieved by the action of the House. The Court must perform its duty under the Constitution "even when the violator be the highest official of the land or the Government itself." (Bondoc v. Pineda, G.R. No. 97710, September 26, 1991)

            The electoral tribunal clearly assumes jurisdiction over all contests relative to the election, returns, and qualifications of candidates for either the Senate or the House only when the latter become members of either the Senate or the House of Representatives.

Thus, petitioner's contention that "after the conduct of the election and (petitioner) has been established the winner of the electoral exercise from the moment of election, the COMELEC is automatically divested of authority to pass upon the question of qualification" finds no basis, because even after the elections the COMELEC is empowered by Section 6 (in relation to Section 7) of Republic Act No. 6646 to continue to hear and decide questions relating to qualifications of candidates.

            We find the respondents' claim to membership in the Commission on Appointments by nomination and election of the LDP majority in the Senate as not in accordance with Section 18 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution and therefore violative of the same because it is not in compliance with the requirements that 12 senators shall be elected on the basis of proportional representation of the resulting fractional membership of the political parties represented therein. To disturb the resulting fractional membership of the political parties in the Commission on Appointments by adding together two halves to make a whole is a breach of the rule on proportional representation because it will give the LDP an added member in the Commission by utilizing the fractional membership of the minority political party, who is deprived of half a representation.

            The provision of Section 18 on proportional repr mandatory in character and does not leave any discretion to the majority party in the Senate to disobey or disregard the rule on proportional representation; otherwise, the party with a majority representation in the Senate or the House of Representatives can by sheer force of number impose its will on the hapless minority. By requiring a proportional representation in the Commission on Appointments, Section 18 in effect works as a check on the majority party in the Senate and helps to maintain the balance of power. No party can claim more than what it is entitled to under such rule. To allow it to elect more than its proportional share of members is to confer upon such a party a greater share in the membership in the Commission on Appointments and more power to impose its will on the minority, who by the same token, suffers a diminution of its rightful membership in the Commission.

            The Constitution does not contemplate that the Commission of of the House of Representatives. What the Constitution requires is Appointments must necessarily include 12 senators and 12 members that there be at least a majority of the entire membership. Under Section 18, the Commission shall rule by majority vote of all the members and in Section 19, the Commission shall meet only while congress is in session, at the call of its Chairman or a majority of conferred upon it." Implementing the above provisions of the all its members "to discharge such powers and functions herein Constitution, Section Sec. 10., Chapter 3 of the Rules of the Commission on Appointments, provides as follows:

            Place of Meeting and Quorum: The Commission shall meet at either the session hall of the Senate or the House of Representatives upon call of the Chairman or as the Commission may designate. The presence of at least thirteen (13) members is necessary to constitute a quorum. Provided, however, that at least four (4) of the members constituting the quorum should come from either house...

            It is quite evident that the Constitution does not require the election and presence of 12 senators and 12 members of the House of Representatives in order that the Commission may function, as there are other instances that may be mentioned about Constitutional collegial bodies which perform their functions regardless of their composition as expressly specified by the Constitution.

            It may also be mentioned that while the Constitution provides for equal membership from the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Commission on Appointments, the senators on one hand, and the representatives, on the other, do not vote separately but jointly, and usually along party lines. Even if Senator Tañada would not be able to sit in the Commission on Appointments. the LP-LDP-LABAN would still be represented in the Commission by Congressman Ponce Enrile who has become a member of the LP. On the other hand, there is nothing to stop any of the political party in order to fill up the two vacancies resulting from this decision. (Guingona v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 106971, October 20, 1992)

            In the 1987 Constitution, however, as already pointed out, the clear and expressed intent of its framers was to exclude presidential appointments from confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, except appointments to offices expressly mentioned in the first sentence of Section 16, Article VII. Consequently, there was no reason to use in the third sentence of Section 16, Article VII the word "alone" after the word "President" in providing that Congress may by law vest the appointment of lower-ranked officers in the President alone, or in the courts, or in the heads of departments because the power to appoint officers whom he (the President) may be authorized by law to appoint is already vested in the President, without the need of confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, in the second sentence of the same Section 16, Article VII.

            Therefore, the third sentence of Section 16, Article VII could have stated merely that, in the case of lower-ranked officers, the Congress may by law vest their appointment in the President, in the courts, or in the heads of various departments of the government. In short, the word "alone" in the third sentence of Section 16, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, as a literal import from the last part of paragraph 3, Section 10, Article VII of the 1935 Constitution, appears to be redundant in the light of the second sentence of Section 16, Article VII. And, this redundancy cannot prevail over the clear and positive intent of the framers of the 1987 Constitution that presidential appointments, except those mentioned in the first sentence of Section 16, Article VII, are not subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments.

A good example is found in Section 5, Article II of the Constitution which provides that, "No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof... No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights." On the other hand, <b>procedural limitations</b> are those pertaining to the manner of passing laws. The provision of Section 26(2) which provides that, "No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency..."

            The objectives of Section 26(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, that every bill passed by the Congress shall embrace only one subject which shall be expressed in the title thereof are: 1. To prevent hodge-podge or log-rolling legislation; 2. To prevent surprise or fraud upon the legislature by means of provisions in bills of which the titles gave no information, and which might therefore be overlooked and carelessly and unintentionally adopted; and 3. To fairly apprise the people, through such publication of legislative proceedings as is usually made, of the subjects of legislation that are being considered, in order that they may have opportunity of being heard thereon by petition or otherwise if they shall so desire.

            Section 26(1) of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution is sufficiently complied with where, as in this case, the title is comprehensive the parts of the statute are related and germane to the subject matter enough to embrace the general objective it seeks to achieve, and if all embodied in the title or so long as the same are not inconsistent with or foreign to the general subject and title. Section 44 of Republic Act the subject matter stated in the title of the law. The title of Republic No. 8189 is not isolated considering that it is related and germane to Act No. 8189 is "The Voter's Registration Act of 1996" with a subject matter enunciated in the explanatory note as "AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A GENERAL REGISTRATION OF VOTERS, ADOPTING A SYSTEM OF CONTINUING REGISTRATION, PRESCRIBING APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS THEREFOR." Section 44, which THE PROCEDURES THEREOF AND AUTHORIZING THE provides for the reassignment of election officers, is relevant to the subject matter of registration as it seeks to ensure the integrity of the registration process by providing a guideline for the COMELEC to follow in the reassignment of election officers. It is not an alien provision but one which is related to the conduct and procedure of continuing registration of voters. In this regard, it bears stressing that the Constitution does not require Congress to employ in the title of an enactment, language of such precision as to mirror, fully index or catalogue, all the contents and the minute details therein.

            In sum, while Article VI, Section 24 provides that all appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills must "originate exclusively in the House of Representatives," it also adds, "but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments." In the exercise of this power, the Senate may propose an entirely new bill as a substitute measure.

            Major legislation is often introduced in both houses in the form of companion (identical) bills, the purpose of which is to speed up the legislative process by encouraging both chambers to consider the measure simultaneously. Sponsors of companion bills may also hope to dramatize the importance or urgency of the issue and show broad support for the legislation. Then the bill is calendared for the first reading as required by the Constitution.

            Once a measure has been introduced and given a number, it is read and referred to an appropriate committee. It must be noted that during the reading of the bill, only the title and the author is read on the floor. The Senate President or the Speaker of the House of Representatives as the case may be is responsible for referring bills introduced to appropriate committees. (https://www.senate. gov.ph/about/legpro.asp - accessed date: 6/1/2020)

            During the second reading of the bill, the debates between the pros and the antis would take place. Amendments may also be introduced. The bill shall be submitted to final vote by yeas and nays after printed copies thereof in final form have been distributed to the members at least three days prior to their passage, except when the President of the Philippines certifies to the necessity of their immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency, in which case the voting on third reading may take place immediately after second reading. After the bill is approved on the third reading. it will be submitted to the House of Representatives or to the Senate for consideration as the case may be. A bill passed by the Senate and transmitted to the House usually goes to a committee, unless a House bill on the same subject has already been reported out by the appropriate committee and placed on the calendar.

            As to what Presidential certification can accomplish, we have already explained in the main decision that the phrase "except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment, etc." in Article VI, Section 26(2) qualifies not only the requirement that "printed copies [of a bill] in its final form [must be] distributed to the members three days before its passage" but also the requirement that before a bill can become a law it must have passed "three readings on separate days." There is not only textual support for such construction but historical basis as well.

            The exception is based on the prudential consideration that if separate has to be printed in final form before it can be passed, the need for a law may be rendered academic by the occurrence of the very emergency or public calamity which it is meant to address.

There were two consuls every year; either consul could block military or civil action by the other. The tribunes had the power to unilaterally block any action by a Roman magistrate or the decrees passed by the Roman Senate. (Spitzer, Robert J. [1988]. The presidential veto: touchstone of the American presidency. SUNY Press. pp. 1-2)

            The act of the Executive in vetoing the particular provisions is an exercise of a constitutionally vested power. But even as the Constitution grants the power, it also provides limitations to its exercise. The veto power is not absolute.

            The pertinent provision of the Constitution reads: The President shall have the power to veto any particular item or items in an appropriation, revenue or tariff bill but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object. (Section 27[2]. Article VI, Constitution)

            The President is, therefore, compelled to approve into law entire bill, including its undesirable parts. It is for this reason that the the Constitution has wisely provided the "item veto power" to avoid inexpedient riders being attached to an indispensable appropriation or revenue measure. (Bengzon v. Drilon, G.R. No. 103524, April 15, 1992)

            By way of definition, a congressional veto is a means whereby the legislature can block or modify administrative action taken under of particular executive actions. The form may be either negative, a statute. It is a form of legislative control in the implementation that is requiring disapproval of the executive action, or affirmative, requiring approval of the executive action. This device represents a significant attempt by Congress to move from oversight of the executive to shared administration.

            A congressional veto is subject to serious questions involving the principle of separation of powers.

In other words, in terms of time horizons, an appropriation may be made impliedly (as by past but subsisting legislations) as well as expressly for the current fiscal year (as by enactment of laws by the present Congress), just as said appropriation may be made in general as well as in specific terms. The Congressional authorization may be embodied in annual laws, such as a general appropriations act or in special provisions of laws of general or special application which appropriate public funds for specific public purposes, such as the questioned decrees.

            Just like any congressional power, there are constitutional limitations on the power of appropriation. The following are limitations set forth in the Constitution: a. appropriations must be for a public purpose; b. the appropriation must be by law; c. Congress cannot appropriate public funds or property, directly or indirectly, in favor of any sect, church, denomination, or sectarian institution or system of religion or any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary as such. However, appropriations may be made to pay a priest or a minister if he is assigned as to the Armed Forces, any penal institution, government orphanage, and leprosarium. Furthermore, the government is not prohibited from appropriating money for a valid secular purpose, even if it incidentally benefits a religion.

            In the case of Aglipay v. Ruiz, Monsignor Gregorio Aglipay, Supreme Head of the Philippine Independent Church, filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent Director of Posts from issuing and selling postage stamps commemorative of the Thirty-third International Eucharistic Congress of the Catholic Church.

            But the Court denied the petition on the ground that the more important question raised refers to the alleged violation of the Constitution by the respondent in issuing and selling postage stamps commemorative of the Thirty-third International Eucharistic Congress.

            The Court said that the prohibition herein expressed is a direct corollary of the principle of separation of church and state. Without the necessity of adverting to the historical background of this principle in our country, it is sufficient to say that our history, not to speak of the history of mankind, has taught us that the union of church and state is prejudicial to both, for occasions might arise when the estate will use the church, and the church the state, as a weapon in the furtherance of their recognized this principle of separation of church and state in the early stages of our constitutional development xxx It is almost trite to say now that in this country we enjoy both religious and civil freedom. All the officers of the Government, from the highest to the lowest, in taking their oath to support and defend the constitution, bind themselves to recognize and respect the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, with its inherent limitations and recognized implications. It should be stated that what is guaranteed by our Constitution is religious liberty, not mere religious toleration.

            Religious freedom, however, as a constitutional mandate is not inhibition of profound reverence for religion and is not denial of its influence in human affairs. Religion as a profession of faith to an active power that binds and elevates man to his Creator is recognized. And, in so far as it instills into the minds the purest principles of morality, its influence is deeply felt and highly appreciated. When the Filipino people, in the preamble of their Constitution, implored "the aid of Divine Providence, in order to establish a government that shall embody their ideals, conserve and develop the patrimony of the nation, promote the general welfare, and secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of independence under a regime of justice, liberty and democracy," they thereby manifested reliance upon Him who guides the destinies of men and nations. The elevating influence of religion in human society is recognized here as elsewhere. (Aglipay v. Ruiz, G.R. No. L-45459, March 13, 1937)

Roses have also been placed over confessionals as a symbol of the confidentiality of confession. Sub rosa entered the English language in the 17th century, and even before then, people were using the English version, "under the rose." Earlier still, unter der rose was apparently used in Germany, where the phrase is thought to have originated. (https://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/sub-rosa- accessed date: 6/1/2020)

            As the Constitution is explicit that the provision which Congress can include in an appropriations bill must "relate specifically to some particular appropriation therein" and "be limited in its operation to the appropriation to which it relates," it follows that any provision which does not relate to any particular item, or which extends in its operation beyond an item of appropriation, is considered "an inappropriate provision" which can be vetoed separately from an item. Also, to be included in the category of "inappropriate provisions" are unconstitutional provisions and provisions which are intended to amend other laws, because clearly these kinds of laws have no place in an appropriations bill. These are matters of general legislation more appropriately dealt with in separate enactments. Former Justice Irene Cortes, as Amicus Curiae, commented that Congress cannot by law establish conditions for and regulate the exercise of powers of the President given by the Constitution for that would be an unconstitutional intrusion into executive prerogative.

            All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills,  bills authorizing  increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments. (Section 24, Article VI)

            In the landmark case decided in 1819 by the Supreme Court of the United States, McCulloch vs. Maryland, 17 U.S. 4 Wheat. 316 316 [1819], Chief Justice John Marshall handed down one of his most important decisions regarding the expansion of Federal power. This case involved the power of Congress to charter a bank, which sparked the even broader issue of the division of powers between state and the Federal Government. Justice Marshall also determined that Maryland could not tax the bank without violating the constitution since, as Marshall commented, "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." The Court thus struck down the tax as an unconstitutional attempt by a state to interfere with a federal institution, in violation of the Supremacy Clause.

            The power of taxation is sometimes called also the power to destroy. Therefore, it should be exercised with caution to minimize injury to the proprietary rights of a taxpayer. It must be exercised lays the golden egg." And, in order to maintain the general public's fairly, equally and uniformly, lest the tax collector kill the "hen that trust and confidence in the Government, this power must be used justly and not treacherously. it does not conform with our sense of justice in the instant case for the Government to persuade the taxpayer to lend it a helping hand and later on to penalize him for duly answering the urgent call. (Roxas v. Court of Tax Appeals, G.R. No. L-25043, April 26, 1968)

            However, in an oft quoted dissenting opinion of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in the case of Panhandle Oil Co. us. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U.S. 218, 223 [1928] it was stated that "the power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits."

            In our jurisdiction, the Supreme Court ruled that: the power to tax, to borrow from Justice Malcolm, "is an attribute of sovereignty. It is the strongest of all the powers of government." It is, of course, to be admitted that for all its plenitude, the power to tax is not unconfined. There are restrictions. The Constitution sets forth such limits. Adversely affecting as it does property rights, both the due process and equal protection clauses may properly be invoked, as petitioner does, to invalidate in appropriate cases a revenue measure. If it were otherwise, there would be truth to the 1803 dictum of Chief Justice Marshall that, "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." (Sison u. Ancheta, G.R. No. L-59431, July 25, 1984)

            """<b>Investigations in Aid of Legislation</b>
            The Senate or the House of Representatives or any of its respective committees may conduct inquiries in aid of legislation in accordance with its duly published rules of procedure. The rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries shall be respected. (Section 21, Article VI)

            Although there is no provision in the Constitution expressly investing either House of Congress with power to make investigations and exact testimony to the end that it may exercise its legislative functions advisedly and effectively, such power is so far incidental to the legislative function as to be implied. In other words, the power of inquiry with process to enforce it is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information - which is not infrequently true- recourse mere requests for such information are often unavailing, and also must be had to others who do possess it. Experience has shown that that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so, some means of compulsion is essential to obtain what is needed.

            That this power of inquiry is broad enough to cover officials of the executive branch may be deduced from the same case. The power of inquiry, the Court therein ruled, is co-extensive with the power to legislate. The matters which may be a proper subject of legislation and those which may be a proper subject of investigation are one. It follows that the operation of government, being a legitimate subject for legislation, is a proper subject for investigation.

            Thus, the Court found that the Senate investigation of the government transaction involved in Arnault was a proper exercise of the power of inquiry. Besides being related to the expenditure of public funds of which Congress is the guardian, the transaction, the Court held, "also involved government agencies created by Congress and officers whose positions it is within the power of Congress to regulate or even abolish." Since Congress has authority to inquire into the operations of the executive branch, it would be incongruous to hold that the power of inquiry does not extend to executive officials who are the most familiar with and informed on executive operations. (Senate v. Ermita, G.R. No. 169777, April 20, 2006)
            """,
            """<b>Limitations on Legislative Investigations</b>
            The power of both houses of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation is not, therefore, absolute or unlimited. Its exercise is circumscribed by the afore-quoted provision of the Constitution. Thus, as provided therein, the investigation must be "in aid of legislation in accordance with its duly published rules of procedure" and that "the rights of persons appearing in or affected of persons under the Bill of Rights must be respected, including by such inquiries shall be respected." It follows then that the rights the right to due process and the right not to be compelled to testify against one's self.

           The power to conduct formal inquiries or investigations is specifically provided for in Section 1 of the Senate Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation. Such inquiries  future may refer to the implementation or re-examination of any law or in connection with any proposed legislation or the formulation of legislation. They may also extend to any and all matters vested by the Constitution in Congress and/or in the Senate alone.

           As held in Jean L. Arnault v. Leon Nazareno, et al., G.R. No. L-3820, July 18, 1950, the inquiry, to be within the jurisdiction of the legislative body making it, must be material or necessary to the exercise of a power in it vested by the Constitution, such as to legislate or to expel a member.

           The power of congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad, it encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed, or possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our social, economic, or political system for the purpose of enabling Congress to remedy them.

           But broad as it is, this power of inquiry is not unlimited. There is no general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of congress. This was freely conceded by Solicitor General in his argument in this case. Nor is the Congress a law enforcement or trial agency. These are functions of the executive and judicial departments of government. No inquiry is an end in itself; it must be related to and in furtherance of a legitimate task of Congress. Investigations conducted solely for the personal aggrandizement of the investigators or to "punish" those investigated are indefensible.

           Moreover, this right of the accused is extended to respondents in administrative investigations but only if they partake of the nature of a criminal proceeding or analogous to a criminal proceeding. In Galman v. Pamaran, G.R. Nos. 71208-09, August 30, 1985, the Court reiterated the doctrine in Cabal v. Kapuanan, 6 SCRA 1059, to illustrate the right of witnesses to invoke the right against self- incrimination not only in criminal proceedings but also in all other types of suit. (Bengzon v. Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, G.R. No. 89914, November 20, 1991)

           Section 21, Article VI, likewise establishes crucial safeguards that proscribe the legislative power of inquiry. The provision requires that the inquiry be done in accordance with the Senate or House's duly published rules of procedure, necessarily implying the constitutional infirmity of an inquiry conducted without duly published rules of procedure. Section 21 also mandates that the rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries be respected, an imposition that obligates Congress to adhere to the  guarantees in the Bill of Rights.

           These abuses are, of course, remediable before the courts, upon the proper suit filed by the persons affected, even if they belong to the executive branch. Nonetheless, there may be exceptional circumstances, none appearing to obtain at present, wherein clear pattern of abuse of the legislative power of inquiry might be established, resulting in palpable violations of the rights guaranteed to members of the executive department under the Bill of Rights. In such instances, depending on the particulars of each case, attempts by the Executive Branch to forestall these abuses may be accorded judicial sanction.

           Even where the inquiry is in aid of legislation, there are still recognized exemptions to the power of inquiry, which exemptions fall under the rubric of "executive privilege." Since this term figures prominently in the challenged order, it being mentioned in its provisions, its preambular clauses, and in its very title, a discussion of executive privilege is crucial for determining the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 464.

            """<b>Claim of Executive Privilege</b>  
            When Congress exercises its power of inquiry, the only way for department heads to exempt themselves therefrom is by a valid claim of privilege. They are not exempt by the mere fact that they are department heads. Only one executive official may be exempted from this power-the President on whom executive power is vested. hence, beyond the reach of Congress except through the power impeachment. It is based on her being the highest official of the executive branch, and the due respect accorded to a co-equal branch of governments which is sanctioned by a long-standing custom.

            Thus, if what is involved is the presumptive privilege of presidential communications when invoked by the President on a matter clearly within the domain of the Executive, the said presumption dictates that the same be recognized and be given preference or priority, in the absence of proof of a compelling or critical need for disclosure by the one assailing such presumption. Any construction to the contrary will render meaningless the presumption accorded by settled jurisprudence in favor of executive privilege. In fact, Senate v. Ermita reiterates jurisprudence citing "the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications." (Neri v. Senate, G.R. No. 180643, March 25, 2008)

            The phrase "executive privilege" is not new in this jurisdiction. It has been used even prior to the promulgation of the 1986 Constitution. Being of American origin, it is best understood in light of how it has been defined and used in the legal literature of the United States. Schwartz defines executive privilege as "the power of the Government to withhold information from the public, the courts, and the Congress." Similarly, Rozell defines it as "the right of the President and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts, and ultimately the public."

            Executive privilege is, nonetheless, not a clear or unitary concept. It has encompassed claims of varying kinds. Tribe, in fact, comments that while it is customary to employ the phrase "executive privilege," it may be more accurate to speak of executive privileges "since presidential refusals to furnish information may be actuated by any of at least three distinct kinds of considerations, and may be asserted, with differing degrees of success, in the context of either judicial or legislative investigations." (Senate v. Ermita, G.R. No. 169777, April 20, 2006)
            """,
            """<b>Question Hour</b>
            The heads of departments may upon their own initiative, with the consent of the President, or upon the request of either House, as the rules of each House shall provide, appear before and be heard by such House on any matter pertaining to their departments. Written questions shall be submitted to the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives at least three days before their scheduled appearance. Interpellations shall not be limited to written questions but may cover matters related thereto. When the security of the State or the public interest so requires and the President so states in writing, the appearance shall be conducted in executive session. (Section 22, Article VI)

            Sections 21 and 22, therefore, while closely related and complementary to each other, should not be considered as pertaining to the same power of Congress. One specifically relates to the power to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation, the aim of which is to elicit information that may be used for legislation, while the other pertains to the power to conduct a question hour, the objective of which is to obtain information in pursuit of Congress' oversight function."

            When Congress merely seeks to be informed on how department heads are implementing the statutes which it has issued, its right to whom, as Chief Executive, such department heads must give a to such information is not as imperative as that of the President Section 22, in keeping with the separation of powers, states that report of their performance as a matter of duty. In such instances, Congress may only request their appearance. Nonetheless, when the inquiry in which Congress requires their appearance is "in aid of legislation" under Section 21, the appearance is mandatory for the same reasons stated in Arnault.

            In fine, the oversight function of Congress may be facilitated by compulsory process only to the extent that it is performed in pursuit of legislation. This is consistent with the intent discerned from the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission. Ultimately, the power of Congress to compel the appearance of executive officials under Section 21 and the lack of it under Section 22 find their basis in the principle of separation of powers. While the executive branch is a co-equal branch of the legislature, it cannot frustrate the power of Congress to legislate by refusing to comply with its demands for information.

            When Congress exercises its power of inquiry, the only way for department heads to exempt themselves therefrom is by a valid claim of privilege. They are not exempt by the mere fact that they are department heads. Only one executive official may be exempted from this power- the President on whom executive power is vested, hence, beyond the reach of Congress except through the impeachment. It is based on her being the highest official of the executive branch, and the due respect accorded to a co-equal branch of government which is sanctioned by a long-standing custom.

            By the same token, members of the Supreme Court are also exempt from this power of inquiry. Unlike the Presidency, judicial power is vested in a collegial body; hence, each member thereof is exempt on the basis not only of separation of powers but also on the fiscal autonomy and the constitutional independence of the judiciary. This point is not in dispute, as even counsel for the Senate, Sen. Joker Arroyo, admitted it during the oral argument upon interpellation of the Chief Justice.

            Having established the proper interpretation of Section 22, constitutionality of Section 1 of Executive Order No. 464. Section Article VI of the Constitution, the Court now proceeds to pass on the Constitution and the absence of any reference to inquiries in aid 1, in view of its specific reference to Section 22 of Article VI of the of legislation, must be construed as limited in its application to appearances of department heads in the question hour contemplated in the provision of said Section 22 of Article VI. The reading is dictated by the basic rule of construction that issuances must be interpreted, as much as possible, in a way that will render it constitutional.

            The requirement then to secure presidential consent under Section 1, limited as it is only to appearances in the question hour, is valid on its face. For under Section 22, Article VI of the Constitution, the appearance of department heads in the question hour is discretionary on their part. Section 1 cannot, however, be applied to appearances of department heads in inquiries in aid of legislation. Congress is not bound in such instances to respect the refusal of the department head to appear in such inquiry, unless a valid claim of privilege is subsequently made, either by the President herself or by the Executive Secretary.

            """<b>Contempt Powers</b>
            Contempt of court is a defiance of the authority, justice, or dignity of the court, such conduct as tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or to interfere with or prejudice parties, litigant, or their witnesses during litigation.

            There are two kinds of contempt punishable by law: direct contempt and indirect contempt. Direct contempt is committed when a person is guilty of misbehavior in the presence of or so near a court as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before the same, including disrespect toward the court, offensive personalities toward others, or refusal to be sworn or to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an affidavit or deposition when lawfully required to do so. Indirect contempt or constructive contempt is that which is committed out of the presence of the court. Any improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice would constitute indirect contempt. (Baculi v. Judge Belen, A.M. No. RTJ-09-2176, April 20, 2009)

            The exercise of the power to punish contempt has two-fold aspects, namely: (1) the proper punishment of the guilty party for his disrespect to the court or its order; and (2) to compel his performance of some acts or duty required of him by the court which he refuses to perform. Due to this two-fold aspect of the exercise of the A civil contempt is the failure to do something ordered to be done power to punish them, contempts are classified as civil or criminal by a court or a judge for the benefit of the opposing party therein, and a criminal contempt, is conduct directed against the authority discrediting the authority or dignity of the court or judge, or in doing and dignity of a court or of a judge, as in unlawfully assailing or a duly forbidden act. Where the punishment imposed, whether against a party to a suit or a stranger, is wholly or primarily to protect or vindicate the dignity and power of the court either by the fine payable to the government or by imprisonment, or both, it deemed a judgment in a criminal case. (Philippine Railway Co. Paredes, G.R. No. L-44983, March 31, 1936)

            The Senate has empowered the committee to continue the investigation during the recess. By refusing to answer the questions the witness has obstructed the performance by the Senate of its legislative function, and the Senate has the power to remove the obstruction by compelling the witness to answer the questions through restraint of his liberty until he shall have answered them. That power subsists as long as the Senate, which is a continuing body, persists in performing the particular legislative function involved. To hold that it may punish the witness for contempt only during the session in which investigation was begun, would be to recognize the right of the Senate to perform its function but at the same time to deny to it an essential and appropriate means for its performance. Aside from this, if we should hold that the power to punish for contempt terminates upon the adjournment of the session, the Senate would have to resume the investigation at the next and succeeding sessions and repeat the contempt proceedings against the witness until the investigation is completed - an absurd. unnecessary, and vexatious procedure, which should be avoided.

            """<b>Imprisonment for Legislative Contempt</b> 
            The principle that Congress or any of its bodies has the power to punish recalcitrant witnesses is founded upon reason and policy. Said power must be considered implied or incidental to the exercise of legislative power, or necessary to effectuate said power. How could a legislative body obtain the knowledge and information on which to base intended legislation if it cannot require and compel the disclosure of such knowledge and information, if it is impotent to punish a defiance of its power and authority? When the framers making each branch supreme within the realm of its respective of the Constitution adopted the principle of separation of powers, authority, it must have intended each department's authority to be full and complete, independently of the other's authority and power. And how could the authority and power become complete if for every it, the legislative body must resort to the judicial department for act of refusal, every act of defiance, every act of contumacy against the appropriate remedy, because it is impotent by itself to punish or deal therewith, with the affronts committed against its authority or dignity. The process by which a contumacious witness is dealt with by the legislature in order to enable it to exercise its legislative power or authority must be distinguished from the judicial process by which offenders are brought to the courts of justice for the meting of the punishment which the criminal law imposes upon them. The former falls exclusively within the legislative authority, the latter within the domain of the courts; because the former is a necessary concomitant of the legislative power or process, while the latter has to do with the enforcement and application of the criminal law.

            One last contention of petitioner remains to be considered. It is the claim that as the period of imprisonment has lasted for the period which exceeded that provided by law as punishment for contempt, i.e., 6 months of arresto mayor, the petitioner is now entitled to be released. This claim is not justified by the record. Petitioner was originally confined by Resolution No. 17 on May 15, 1950. On December 13, 1951, he executed his affidavit and thereafter he was called to testify again before the Senate Committee. The latter passed its Resolution No. 114 on November 6, 1952, and he presented the petition for habeas corpus in this case on March 3, 1953, i.e.. five months after the last resolution when the Senate found that the petitioner committed another contempt. It is not true, therefore, that the petitioner's punishment is beyond the full period prescribed in the criminal law. 

            Besides, the last resolution of November 8, 1952 is also of a coercive nature, in the sense that the Senate Committee still demands and requires the disclosure of the fact which the petitioner had obstinately refused to divulge. While the Philippine Senate has not given up hope that the petitioner may ultimately disclose the record, it is improper for the courts to declare that the continued confinement is an abuse of the legislative power and thereby interfere in the exercise of the legislative discretion.

            In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may. by law, authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may prescribe, to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy.

            """<b>The Prize Cases</b>
            On April 19 and 27, 1861, Lincoln issued proclamations authorizing a blockade of Confederate ports. Congress did not recognize a state of war until July 13. During that interval of almost three months, the Union Navy captured a number of merchant vessels, and those seizures were challenged in court on the basis that Lincoln had exceeded his constitutional authority.

            When the cases reached the Supreme Court in 1863, the justices ruled by a five to four majority that the president had acted constitutionally. While only Congress could declare war, the chief executive did have a lawful responsibility to take measures to resist insurrection. The court thus sanctioned Lincoln's exercise of emergency powers prior to the congressional authorization of those powers. (The Prize cases, 67 US 635, 17 L. Ed. 459)

            In the case of Mora vs. McNamara, Dennis Mora and several others were drafted into the United States Army in late 1965 and were to be shipped to Vietnam six months later. They brought a suit to prevent the Army from carrying out those orders and requested a declaratory judgment that the present United States military and the court of appeals affirmed. The United States Supreme Court activity in Vietnam is "illegal." The district court dismissed the suit ruled that there are several questions, which are large and deeply troubling. Among them were whether the present United States military activity in Vietnam was a "war" within the meaning o Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution and what relevance  are treaty obligations of the United States? These questions and problems will solve themselves when the Court refuses to hear this case. The Court should squarely face them by granting certiorari and setting this case in for oral argument.

            The United States Constitution inserted the phrase "to declare war" as a check on the Executive when the President might have to take emergency action to protect the security of the United States. It should be a decision that Congress should support. The check was to transfer the power to declare war from the person who was to spend to those who were to pay. (https://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/constitutional-law/constitutional-law-keyed-to-cohen/separation of-powers/mora-v-mcnamara/ - accessed date: 7/1/2020)

            In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may, by law, authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may prescribe, to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy. Unless sooner withdrawn by resolution of the Congress, such powers shall cease upon the next adjournment thereof.

            It may be pointed out that the second paragraph of the above provision refers not only to war but also to "other national emergency." If the intention of the Framers of our Constitution was to withhold from the President the authority to declare a "state of national emergency" pursuant to Section 18, Article VII (calling- out power) and grant it to Congress (like the declaration of the existence of a state of war), then the Framers could have provided 80. Clearly, they did not intend that Congress should first authorize the President before he can declare a "state of national emergency." The logical conclusion then is that President Arroyo could validly declare the existence of a state of national emergency even in the absence of a Congressional enactment.

            But the exercise of emergency powers, such as the taking over of privately-owned public utility or business affected with public interest, is a different matter. This requires a delegation from Congress. Courts have often said that constitutional provisions in pari materia are to be construed together. Otherwise stated, different clauses, sections, and provisions of a constitution which relate to the same subject matter will be construed together and considered in the light of each other. Considering that Section 17 of Article XII and Section 23 of Article VI, previously quoted, relate to national emergencies, they must be read together to determine the

            """<b>Initiative and Referendum</b> 
            The Congress shall, as early as possible, provide for a system the people can directly propose and enact laws or approve or reject of initiative and referendum, and the exceptions therefrom, whereby any act or law or part thereof passed by the Congress or local legislative body after the registration of a petition therefor signed by at least 10 per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters thereof. (Section 32, Article VI)

            <b>Initiative</b> is a means by which a petition signed by a required number of registered voters can force a government to choose to either enact a law or hold a public vote in congress in what is called indirect initiative, or under direct initiative, the proposition is immediately put to a plebiscite or referendum, in what is called a popular initiated referendum or citizen-initiated referendum.

            <b>Referendum</b> is a direct and universal vote in which the entire electorate votes to on a particular proposal which can have nationwide or local forms which result in the adoption of a new policy or specific law.

            Initiative is the "power of the people to propose bills and laws, and to enact or reject them at the polls independent of the legislative assembly." On the other hand, he explains that referendum "is the right reserved to the people to adopt or reject any act or measure which has been passed by a legislative body and which in most cases would without action on the part of electors become a law." (Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 125416, September 26, 1996)

            For the first time in 1987, the system of people's initiative was thus installed in our fundamental law. To be sure, it was a late awakening. As early as 1898, the state of South Dakota has adopted followed suit. In any event, the framers of our 1987 Constitution initiative and referendum in its constitution and many states have realized the value of initiative and referendum as an ultimate weapon of the people to negate government malfeasance and misfeasance and they put in place an overarching system. (Garcia v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 111230, September 30, 1994)
            """,
            """<b>Initiative to Amend the Constitution</b>
            First. Contrary to the assertion of public respondent COMELEC, Section 2 of the Act does not suggest an initiative on amendments to the Constitution. The said section reads: Sec. 2. Statement and Policy The power of the people under a system of initiative and referendum to directly propose, enact, approve or reject, in whole or any legislative body upon compliance with the requirements of this in part, the Constitution, laws, ordinances, or resolutions passed by Act is hereby affirmed, recognized and guaranteed.

            We agree that Republic Act No. 6735 was, as its history reveals, intended to cover initiative to propose amendments to the Constitution. The Act is a consolidation of House Bill No. 21505 and Senate Bill No. 17. The former was prepared by the Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms of the House of Representatives on the basis of two House Bills referred to it, viz., (a) House Bill No. 497, which dealt with the initiative and referendum mentioned in Sections 1 and 32 of Article VI of the Constitution; and (b) House Bill No. 988, which dealt with the subject matter of House Bill No. 497, as well as with initiative and referendum under Section 3 of Article X (Local Government) and initiative provided for in Section 2 of Article XVII of the Constitution. Senate Bill No. 17 solely dealt with initiative and referendum concerning ordinances or resolutions of local government units. The Bicameral Conference Committee consolidated Senate Bill No. 17 and House Bill No. 21505 into a draft bill, which was subsequently approved on 8 June 1989 by the Senate and by the House of Representatives. This approved bill is now Republic Act No. 6735.

            The inclusion of the word "Constitution" therein was a delayed afterthought. That word is neither germane nor relevant to said section, which exclusively relates to initiative and referendum on national laws and local laws, ordinances, and resolutions. That section is silent as to amendments on the Constitution. As pointed out earlier, initiative on the Constitution is confined only to proposals to AMEND. The people are not accorded the power to "directly propose, enact, approve, or reject, in whole or in part, the Constitution" through the system of initiative. They can only do so with respect to "laws, ordinances, or resolutions." The foregoing conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that this section was lifted from Section 1 of Senate Bill No. 17, which solely referred to a statement of policy on local initiative and referendum and appropriately used the phrases "propose and enact," "approve or reject" and "in whole or in part."

            Second. It is true that Section 3 (Definition of Terms) of the Act defines initiative on amendments to the Constitution and mentions it as one of the three systems of initiative, and that Section 5 (Requirements) restates the constitutional requirements as to the percentage of the registered voters who must submit the proposal. But unlike in the case of the other systems of initiative, the Act does not provide for the contents of a petition for initiative on the Constitution. Section 5, paragraph (c) requires, among other things, statement of the proposed law sought to be enacted, approved or rejected, amended or repealed, as the case may be. It does not include, as among the contents of the petition, the provisions of the Constitution sought to be amended, in the case of initiative on the Constitution.

            Third. While the Act provides subtitles for National Initiative and Referendum (Subtitle II) and for Local Initiative and Referendum (Subtitle III), no subtitle is provided for initiative on the Constitution. This conspicuous silence as to the latter simply means that the main thrust of the Act is initiative and referendum on national and local laws. If Congress intended Republic Act No. 6735 to fully provide for the implementation of the initiative on amendments to the Constitution, it could have provided for a subtitle therefor, considering that in the order of things, the primacy of interest, or hierarchy of values, the right of the people to directly propose amendments to the Constitution is far more important than the initiative on national and local laws.

            We cannot accept the argument that the initiative on amendments to the Constitution is subsumed under the subtitle on National Initiative and Referendum because it is national in scope Our reading of Subtitle II (National Initiative and Referendum) and Subtitle III (Local Initiative and Referendum) leaves no room for doubt that the classification is not based on the scope of the initiative involved, but on its nature and character. It is "national law, or a law which only Congress can pass. It is "local initiative" initiative," if what is proposed to be adopted or enacted is a national if what is proposed to be adopted or enacted is a law, ordinance. or resolution which only the legislative bodies of the governments of the autonomous regions, provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays can pass.

            """<b>Resolutions as Subjects of Initiative</b> 
            The Constitution clearly includes not only ordinance but resolutions as appropriate subjects of a local initiative. Section 32 of Article VI provides in luminous language: "The Congress shall, as early as possible, provide for a system of initiative and referendum, and the exceptions therefrom, whereby the people can directly propose and enact laws or approve or reject any act or law or part thereof passed by the Congress, or local legislative body... An act includes a resolution. Black defines an act as "an expression of will or purpose... it may denote something done... as a legislature, including not merely physical acts, but also decrees, edicts, laws, judgments, resolves, awards, and determinations..." It is basic that a law should be construed in harmony with and not in violation of the Constitution. In line with this postulate, we held in In Re Guarina that "if there is doubt or uncertainty as to the meaning of the legislative, if the words or provisions are obscure, or if the enactment is fairly susceptible of two or more constructions, that interpretation will be adopted which will avoid the effect of unconstitutionality, even though it may be necessary, for this purpose, to disregard the more usual or apparent import of the language used."

            In initiative and referendum, the COMELEC exercises administration and supervision of the process itself, akin to its powers over the conduct of elections. These law-making powers belong to the people, hence the respondent Commission cannot control or change the substance or the content of legislation. In the exercise of its authority, it may (in fact it should have done so already) issue relevant and adequate guidelines and rules for the orderly exercise of these "people-power" features of our Constitution.

            Like elections, initiative and referendum are powerful and valuable modes of expressing popular sovereignty. And this Court as a matter of policy and doctrine will exert every effort to nurture, protect and promote their legitimate exercise. For it is but sound public policy to enable the electorate to express their free and untrammeled will, not only in the election of their anointed lawmakers and executives, but also in the formulation of the very rules and laws by which our society shall be governed and managed.

             The power of recall for loss of confidence shall be exercised by the registered voters of a local government unit to which the local elective official subject to such recall belongs. (Section 69, Republic Act No. 7160)

            The right to recall is complementary to the right to elect or appoint. It is included in the right of suffrage. It is based on the theory that the electorate must maintain a direct and elastic control over public functionaries. It is also predicated upon the idea that a public office is "burdened" with public interests and that the representatives of the people holding public offices are simply agents or servants of the people with definite powers and specific duties to perform and to follow if they wish to remain in their respective offices.

            Whether or not the electorate of the Municipality of Sulat has lost confidence in the incumbent mayor is a political question. It belongs to the realm of politics where only the people are the judge. "Loss of confidence is the formal withdrawal by an electorate of their trust in a person's ability to discharge his office previously bestowed on him by the same electorate. The constituents have made a judgment and their will to recall the incumbent mayor (Evardone) has already been ascertained and must be afforded the highest respect. Thus, the signing process held last July 14, 1990 in Sulat Eastern Samar, for the recall of Mayor Felipe P. Evardone of said municipality is valid and has legal effect." (Evardone v.

Those who elect Philippine citizenship in accordance with paragraph (3), Section 1 hereof shall be deemed natural-born citizens.

            There was no such term as "Philippine citizens" during the Spanish regime but "subjects of Spain" or "Spanish subjects." In church records, the natives were called indios,' denoting a low regard for the inhabitants of the archipelago. Spanish laws on citizenship became highly codified during the 19th century but their sheer number made it difficult to point to one comprehensive law. Not all of these citizenship laws of Spain however, were made to apply to the Philippine Islands except for those explicitly extended by Royal Decrees.

It was to ensure a Filipino nationality for the illegitimate did so for the benefit of the child of an alien father in line with the assumption that the mother had custody, would exercise parental authority, and had the duty to support her illegitimate child. It was to help the child, not to prejudice or discriminate against him.

            The fact of the matter consideration - is that the 1935 Constitution, the fundamental law perhaps the most significant prevailing on the day, the month, and year of birth of respondent FPJ, can never be more explicit than it is.

            A perusal of our Constitution will show that extensive authority over the public service is granted to the President of the Philippines. Article VII of the Constitution begins in its Section 1 with the declaration that the "The Executive power shall be vested in a President of the Philippines." All executive authority is thus vested in him, and upon him devolves the constitutional duty of seeing that the laws are "faithfully executed." (Article VII, Section 11, subsection 1, last clause) In the fulfillment of this duty which he cannot evade he is granted specific and express powers and functions. (Article VII, Section 11) In addition to these specific and express powers and functions, he may also exercise those necessarily implied and included in them. (Myers us. United States [1926], 272 U. S., 52;71 Law. ed., 160; 47 Sup. Ct. Rep., 21; Willoughby, Constitution of the United States, sec. 953, citing Taft's Our Chief Magistrate and His Powers, p. 139) The National Assembly may not enact laws which either expressly or impliedly diminish the authority conferred upon the President of the Constitution. (Cf. Concepcion v. Paredes [1921]. 42 Phil. 599)

           The Constitution provides that the President "shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices" (Article VII, Section 11[1] first clause) and shall "exercise general supervision over all local governments as may be provided by law." (Ibid., second clause) This power of control and supervision is an important constitutional grant. The President in the exercise of the executive power under the Constitution may act through the heads of the executive departments. The heads of the executive departments are his authorized assistants and agents in the performance of his executive duties, and their official acts, promulgated in the regular course of business, are presumptively his acts. The power of removal which the President may exercise directly and the practical necessities of efficient government brought about by administrative centralization easily make the President the head of the administration. (Willoughby, Constitution of the United States, Vol. II, 2nd ed., sec. 959) Independently of any statutory provision authorizing the President to conduct an investigation of the nature involved in this proceeding, and in view of the nature and character of the executive authority with which the President of the Philippines is invested, the constitutional grant to him of power to exercise general supervision over all local governments and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed must be construed to authorize him to order an investigation of the act or conduct of the petitioner herein. Supervision is not a meaningless thing. It is an active power. It is certainly not without limitation, but it at least implies authority to inquire into facts and conditions in order to render the power real and effective. If supervision is to be conscientious and rational, and not automatic and brutal, it must be founded upon a knowledge of actual facts and conditions disclosed after careful study and investigation.

           Viewed from the totality of powers conferred upon the Chief Executive by our Constitution, we should be reluctant to yield to the proposition that the President of the Philippines who is endowed with broad and extraordinary powers by our Constitution, and who is expected to govern with a firm and steady hand without vexatious or embarrassing interference and much less dictation from any source, is yet devoid of the power to order the investigation of the petitioner in this case.

It must be conceded that the acts of the Chief Executive performed within the limits of his jurisdiction are his official acts and courts will neither direct nor restrain executive action in such cases. The rule is non-interference. But from this legal premise, it does not necessarily follow that we are precluded from making an inquiry into the validity or constitutionality of his acts when these are separation of governmental powers, whether viewed in the light of properly challenged in an appropriate legal proceeding. The classical the political philosophy of Aristotle, Locke, or Montesquieu, or of the postulations of Mabini, Madison, or Jefferson, is a relative theory of government.

            There is more truism and actuality in interdependence than in independence and separation of powers, for as observed by Justice Holmes in a case of Philippine origin, we cannot lay down "with mathematical precision and divide the branches into watertight Constitution do not establish and divide fields of black and white" but compartments" not only because "the great ordinances of the also because "even the more specific of them are found to terminate in a penumbra shading gradually from one extreme to the other." (Springer vs. Government [1928], 277 U. S., 189; 72 Law. ed., 845, 852) As far as the judiciary is concerned, while it holds "neither the sword nor the purse" it is by constitutional placement the organ called upon to allocate constitutional boundaries, and to the Supreme Court is entrusted expressly or by necessary implication the obligation of determining in appropriate cases the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, law, ordinance, or executive order or regulation. (Section 2[1], Article VIII, Constitution of the Philippines) In this sense and to this extent, the judiciary restrains the other departments of the government and this result is one of the necessary corollaries of the "system of checks and balance" of the government established.

            """<b>Citizenship of a Foundling</b> 
            At the outset, it must be noted that presumptions regarding are neither unknown nor unaccepted in Philippine paternity Law. The Family Code of the Philippines has a whole chapter on Paternity and Filiation. That said, there is more than sufficient evidence that petitioner has Filipino parents and is therefore a natural-born Filipino. Parenthetically, the burden of proof was on private respondents to show that petitioner is not a Filipino citizen. The private respondents should have shown that both of petitioner's parents were aliens. Her admission that she is a foundling did not shift the burden to her because such status did not exclude the possibility that her parents were Filipinos, especially as in this case where there is a high probability, if not certainty, that her parents are Filipinos.

            Other circumstantial evidence of the nationality of petitioner's parents are the fact that she was abandoned as an infant in a Roman Catholic Church in Iloilo City. She also has typical Filipino features: height, flat nasal bridge, straight black hair, almond-shaped eyes, and an oval face.

            There is a disputable presumption that things have happened according to the ordinary course of nature and the ordinary habits of life. All of the foregoing evidence, that a person with typical Filipino features is abandoned in Catholic Church in a municipality where the population of the Philippines is overwhelmingly Filipinos such that there would be more than a 99% chance that a child born in the province would be a Filipino, would indicate more than ample probability if not statistical certainty, that petitioner's parents are Filipinos. That probability and the evidence on which it is based are admissible under Rule 128, Section 4 of the Revised Rules on Evidence.

            We find no such intent or language permitting discrimination against foundlings. On the contrary, all three Constitutions guarantee the basic right to equal protection of the laws. All exhort the State to render social justice. Of special consideration are several provisions in the present charter: Article II, Section 11 which provides that the "State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights," Article XIII, Section 1 which mandates Congress to "give highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of all the people to human dignity, reduce social, economic, and political inequalities x x x" and Article XV, Section 3 which requires the care and nutrition, and special protection from all forms of neglect, State to defend the "right of children to assistance, including proper abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development." Certainly, these provisions contradict an intent to discriminate against foundlings on account of their unfortunate status. (Poe-Llamanzares v. Comelec, G.R. No. 221697, March 28, 2016)

            """<b>Residency Requirement</b> 
            The Constitution requires presidential candidates to have 10 years' residence in the Philippines before the day of the elections. Since the forthcoming elections will be held on May 9, 2016, petitioner must have been a resident of the Philippines prior to May 9, 2016 for 10 years. In answer to the requested information of "Period of Residence in the Philippines up to the day before May 09, 2016," she put in "10 years 11 months" which according to her pleadings in these cases corresponds to a beginning date of May 25, 2005 when she returned for good from the U.S.

            When petitioner immigrated to the U.S. in 1991, she lost her original domicile, which is the Philippines. There are three requisites to acquire a new domicile: 1. Residence or bodily presence in a new locality; 2. an intention to remain there; and 3. an intention to abandon the old domicile. To successfully effect a change of domicile, one must demonstrate an actual removal or an actual change of domicile; a bona fide intention of abandoning the former place of residence and establishing a new one and definite acts which correspond with the purpose. In other words, there must basically be animus manendi coupled with animus non revertendi. The purpose to remain in or at the domicile of choice must be for an indefinite period of time; the change of residence must be voluntary and the residence at the place chosen for the new domicile must be actual.

            As explained by petitioner in her verified pleadings, she misunderstood the date required in the 2013 COC as the period of residence as the day she submitted that COC in 2012. She said that she reckoned residency from April-May 2006 which was the period Philippines. In that regard, she was advised by her lawyers in 2015 when the U.S. house was sold and her husband returned to the that residence could be counted from May 25, 2005.

            Petitioner's explanation that she misunderstood the query in 2012 (period of residence before May 13, 2013) as inquiring about residence as of the time she submitted the COC, is bolstered by the change which the COMELEC itself introduced in the 2015 COC which is now "period of residence in the Philippines up to the day before May 09, 2016." The COMELEC would not have revised the if it did not acknowledge that the first version was vague. That petitioner could have reckoned residence from a date earlier than the sale of her U.S. house and the return of her husband is plausible given the evidence that she had returned a year before. Such evidence, to repeat, would include her passport and the school records of her children. (Poe-Llamanzares v. Comelec, G.R. No. 221697, March 28, 2016)

        'content': [
            """<b>Election Protest of Fernando Poe, Jr.</b> 
            Refusing to concede defeat, the second-placer in the elections, Mr. FPJ, filed seasonably an election protest before this Electoral Tribunal on July 23, 2004. Mrs. GMA, through counsel, filed her Answer with Counter Protest on August 5, 2004. As counsels for the parties exchanged lively motions to rush the presentation of their respective positions on the controversy, an act of God intervened. On December 14, 2004, the Protestant died in the course of his medical treatment at St. Luke's Hospital. The medical certificate, filed counsel as part of the Notice of Death of the Protestant, showed that he died of cardio-pulmonary arrest, secondary to cerebral infarction.

            If one were guided by folk wisdom expressed in the adage that in a democracy, the voice of the people is the voice of God, then it would appear our task had been made easy by fateful events. Past midnight, in the early hours of June 24, 2004, the Congress as the representatives of the sovereign people and acting as the National Board of Canvassers, in a near-unanimous roll-call vote, proclaimed Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) the duly elected President of the Philippines. She obtained 12,905,808 votes, as against 11,782,232 votes for the second-placer, the movie actor Fernando Poe, Jr. (FPJ). She took her Oath of Office before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on June 30, 2004.

            However, neither the Protestee's proclamation by Congress nor the death of her main rival as a fortuitous intervening event, appears to abate the present controversy in the public arena. Instead, notice may be taken of periodic mass actions, demonstrations, and rallies raising an outcry for this Tribunal to decide the electoral protest of Mr. FPJ against Mrs. GMA once and for all. The oracular function of this Tribunal, it would appear, needs to be fully exercised to make manifest here and abroad who is the duly elected leader of the Filipino nation. All these, despite the fact that the submissions by the parties on their respective sides in the protest and the counter- protest are thus far from completed.

            Needless to stress, this Tribunal cannot shirk its constitutional duty. Yet, neither could it go beyond its mandate under the Constitution and the law. Further, this Tribunal is guided by its Rules, as well as the Rules of Court in a suppletory manner. Considering the transcendental importance of the electoral contest involving the Presidency, a rush to judgment is simply out of the question. Yet decide the matter we must, without further delay, to prevent popular unrest and avoid further destabilization of government at the highest level.

            This is not to say that death of the protestant necessarily abates the pending action. We have held as early as Vda. de De Mesa (1966) that while the right to a public office is personal and exclusive to the public officer, an election protest is not purely personal and exclusive to the protestant or to the protestee such that the death of either would oust the court of all authority to continue the protest proceedings. Hence, we have allowed substitution and intervention but only by a real party in interest. A real party in interest is the party who would be benefited or injured by the judgment, and the party who is entitled to the avails of the suit. In Vda. de De Mesa u. 

            Mencias and Lomugdang v. Javier, we permitted substitution by the that if the protest succeeds and the protestee is unseated, the vice- vice-mayor since the vice-mayor is a real party in interest considering mayor succeeds to the office of the mayor that becomes vacant if the one duly elected cannot assume office. In contrast, herein movant/ of President. Thus, given the circumstances of this case, we can intervenor, Mrs. FPJ, herself denies any claim to the august office conclude that protestant's widow is not a real party in interest to this election protest.

So help me God." [In case of affirmation, last sentence will be omitted] (Section 5, Article VII)

            An oath is a solemn promise about one's behavior or actions. Often, when one takes an oath, the promise invokes a divine being. On the other hand, affirmation is the act of confirming something to be true, or a written or oral statement that confirms that something is true.

            An affirmation is a verbal, solemn, and formal declaration, which is made in place of an oath. A person may choose to make an affirmation rather than taking an oath. An affirmation has the same effect as an oath but does not use a religious text. (https://www. victimsupport.act.gov.au/- accessed date: 7/14/2020)

            """<b>Presidential Immunity</b>
            The petition amounts in effect to a suit against the incumbent President of the Republic, President Corazon C. Aquino, and it is equally elementary that incumbent Presidents are immune from suit or from being brought to court during the period of their incumbency and tenure. (In re Bermudez, G.R. No. 76180, October 24, 1986)

            The rationale for the grant to the President of the privilege of immunity from suit is to assure the exercise of Presidential duties and functions free from any hindrance or distraction, considering that being the Chief Executive of the Government is a job that, aside from requiring all of the office holder's time, also demands undivided attention.

            But this privilege of immunity from suit pertains to the President by virtue of the office and may be invoked only by the holder of the office; not by any other person on the President's behalf. Thus, an accused in a criminal case in which the President is complainant cannot raise the presidential privilege as a defense to prevent the case from proceeding against such accused.

            Moreover, there is nothing in our laws that would prevent the President from waiving the privilege. Thus, if so, minded the President may shed the protection afforded by the privilege and submit to the court's jurisdiction. The choice of whether to exercise the privilege or to waive it, is solely the President's prerogative. It is a decision that cannot be assumed and imposed by any other person. (Soliven v. Makasiar, G.R. No. 82585, November 14, 1988)

            The Court also stresses the rule that the presidential immunity from suit exists only in concurrence with the president's incumbency. invoked by a non-sitting president even for acts committed during Conversely, this presidential privilege of immunity cannot his or her tenure. Courts look with disfavor upon the presidential privilege of immunity, especially when it impedes the search for truth or impairs the vindication of a right. (Saez v. Macapagal Arroyo, G.R. No. 183533, September 25, 2012)

            We now come to the scope of immunity that can be claimed by petitioner as a non-sitting President. The cases filed against petitioner Estrada are criminal in character. They involve plunder, bribery, and graft and corruption. By no stretch of the imagination can these crimes, especially plunder which carries the death penalty, be covered by the alleged mantle of immunity of a non- sitting president. Petitioner cannot cite any decision of this Court licensing the President to commit criminal acts and wrapping him with post-tenure immunity from liability. It will be anomalous to hold that immunity is an inoculation from liability for unlawful acts and conditions. The rule is that unlawful acts of public officials are not acts of the State and the officer who acts illegally is not acting as such but stands in the same footing as any trespasser.

            There are more reasons not to be sympathetic to appeals to stretch the scope of executive immunity in our jurisdiction. One of the great themes of the 1987 Constitution is that a public office is a public trust. It declared as a state policy that "the State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption." It ordained that, "public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice. and lead modest lives." It set the rule that 'the right of the State to recover properties unlawfully acquired by public officials or employees, from them or from their nominees or transferees, shall not be barred by prescription, latches or estoppel.' It maintained the Sandiganbayan as an anti-graft court. It created the office of the Ombudsman and endowed it with enormous powers, among which is to "investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust improper or inefficient. The Office of the Ombudsman was also given fiscal  .These constitutional policies will be devalued if we sustain petitioner's claim that a non-sitting president enjoys immunity from suit for criminal acts committed during his incumbency. (Estrada v. Arroyo, G.R. No. 146738, March 2, 2001)

            Petitioner stubbornly clings to the contention that he is entitled to absolute immunity from suit. His arguments are merely recycled, and we need not prolong the longevity of the debate on the subject. In our Decision, we exhaustively traced the origin of executive immunity in our jurisdiction and its bends and turns up to the present time. We held that given the intent of the 1987 Constitution to breathe life to the policy that a public office is a public trust, the petitioner, as a non-sitting President, cannot claim executive immunity for his alleged criminal acts committed as a sitting President. Petitioner's rehashed arguments including their thinly disguised new spins are based on the rejected contention that he is still President, albeit, a President on leave. His stance that his immunity covers his entire term of office or until June 30, 2004 disregards the reality that he has relinquished the presidency and there is now a new de jure President.

            Indeed, petitioner's stubborn stance cannot but bolster the belief that the cases at bar were filed not really for petitioner to reclaim the presidency but just to take advantage of the immunity attached to the presidency and thus, derail the investigation of the criminal cases pending against him in the Office of the Ombudsman.

            """<b>Prohibited Acts</b> 
            Despite the broad and overreaching powers of the president, there are acts which the Constitution forbids him/her from committing such as:

            a. The President and Vice President shall not receive any other emoluments from the government or any other source (Section 6)

            b. Unless otherwise provided in the constitution, shall not hold any other office or employment (Section 13)

            The prohibition against holding dual or multiple offices or employment under Section 13, Article VII of the Constitution must not, however, be construed as applying to posts occupied by the Executive officials specified therein without additional compensation in an ex-officio capacity as provided by law and as required by the primary functions of said officials' office. The reason is that these posts do no comprise "any other office" within the contemplation of the constitutional prohibition but are properly an imposition of additional duties and functions on said officials.

            The prohibition under Section 13, Article VII is not to compensation in ex-officio capacities as provided by law and as be interpreted as covering positions held without additional required by the primary functions of the concerned official's office. The term ex-officio means "from office; by virtue of office." It refers to an "authority derived from official character merely, not expressly conferred upon the individual character, but rather annexed to the official position." Ex-officio likewise denotes an "act done in an official character, or as a consequence of office, and without any other appointment or authority than that conferred by the office." An ex-officio member of a board is one who is a member by virtue of his title to a certain office, and without further warrant or appointment. To illustrate, by express provision of law, the Secretary of Transportation and Communications is the ex-officio Chairman of the Board of the Philippine Ports Authority, and the Light Rail Transit Authority. (National Amnesty Commission v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 156982, September 8, 2004)

            c. Shall not directly or indirectly (1) practice any other profession; (2) participate in any business; or (3) be financially interested in any contract with, or in any franchise or special privilege granted by the government or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries. (Section 13)

            d. Strictly avoid conflict of interest in the conduct of their office. (Section 13)

            e. May not appoint (a) spouse; or (b) relatives by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth civil degree as members of Constitutional Commissions, or the Office of the Ombudsman, or as Secretaries, Undersecretaries, chairmen or heads of bureaus or offices, including government-owned or controlled corporation and their subsidiaries. (Section 13)

            Going further into Section 13, Article VII, the second sentence provides: "They shall not, during said tenure, directly or indirectly. practice any other profession, participate in any business, or be financially interested in any contract with or franchise of special privilege granted by the Government or any subdivision, controlled corporations or their subsidiaries." These sweeping, all- agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or embracing prohibitions imposed on the President and his official family, which prohibitions are not similarly imposed on other public officials or employees such as the Members of Congress, members of the civil service in general and members of the armed forces, are proof of the intent of the 1987 Constitution to treat the President and his official family as a class by itself and to impose upon said class stricter prohibitions.

            Such intent of the 1986 Constitutional Commission to be stricter with the President and his official family was also succinctly articulated by Commissioner Vicente Foz after Commissioner Regalado Maambong noted during the floor deliberations and debate that there was no symmetry between the Civil Service prohibitions, originally found in the General Provisions and the anticipated report on the Executive Department. Commissioner Foz commented, "We actually have to be stricter with the President and the members of the Cabinet because they exercise more powers and, therefore, more checks and restraints on them are called for because there is more possibility of abuse in their case."

            Since the evident purpose of the framers of the 1987 Constitution is to impose a stricter prohibition on the President, Vice-President, members of the Cabinet, their deputies, and assistants with respect to holding multiple offices or employment in the government during their tenure, the exception to this prohibition must be read with equal severity. On its face, the language of Section 13, Article VII is prohibitory so that it must be understood as intended to be a positive and unequivocal negation of the privilege of holding multiple government offices or employment. Verily, wherever the language used in the constitution is prohibitory, it is to be understood as intended to be a positive and unequivocal negation. The phrase "unless otherwise provided in this Constitution" must be given a literal interpretation to refer only to those particular instances cited in the Constitution itself, to wit: the Vice-President being appointed as a member of the Cabinet under Section 3, paragraph (2), Article VII; or acting as President in those instances provided under Section 7, paragraphs (2) and (3), Article VII; and the Secretary of Justice being ex-officio member of the Judicial and Bar Council by virtue of Section 8(1), Article VIII.

            The prohibition against holding dual or multiple offices or employment under Section 13, Article VII of the Constitution must not, however, be construed as applying to posts occupied by the in an ex-officio capacity as provided by law and as required by the Executive officials specified therein without additional compensation primary functions of said officials' office. The reason is that these posts do no comprise "any other office" within the contemplation of the constitutional prohibition but are properly an imposition of additional duties and functions on said officials. To characterize these posts otherwise would lead to absurd consequences, among which are: The President of the Philippines cannot chair the National Security Council reorganized under Executive Order No. 115 (December 24, 1986). Neither can the Vice-President, the Executive Secretary, and the Secretaries of National Defense, Justice, Labor and Employment and Local Government sit in this Council, which would then have no reason to exist for lack of a chairperson and members. The respective undersecretaries and assistant secretaries would also be prohibited. (Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary, G.R. No. 83896, February 22, 1991)

            """<b>The Inability of President Estrada</b> 
            What leaps to the eye from these irrefutable facts is that both houses of Congress have recognized respondent Arroyo as the President. Implicitly clear in that recognition is the premise that the inability of petitioner Estrada is no longer temporary. Congress has clearly rejected petitioner's claim of inability.

            The question is whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the claim of temporary inability of petitioner Estrada and thereafter Arroyo as president of the Philippines. Following Tañada v. Cuenco, we hold that this Court cannot exercise its judicial power or this is revise the decision of both Houses of Congress recognizing respondent an issue "in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the Legislative branch of the government." Or to use the language in Baker v. Carr, there is a "textually demonstrable or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it." Clearly, the Court cannot pass upon petitioner's claim of inability to discharge the power and duties of the presidency. The question is political in nature and addressed solely to Congress by constitutional fiat. It is a political issue, which cannot be decided by this Court without transgressing the principle of separation of powers.

            In fine, even if the petitioner can prove that he did not resign, still, he cannot successfully claim that he is a President on leave on the ground that he is merely unable to govern temporarily. That claim has been laid to rest by Congress and the decision that respondent Arroyo is the de jure, president made by a co-equal branch of government cannot be reviewed by this Court. (Estrada v.

            """<b>Did President Estrada Resign?</b> 
            In the cases at bar, the facts show that petitioner did not write any formal letter of resignation before he evacuated Malacañang Palace in the afternoon of January 20, 2001 after the oath-taking of respondent Arroyo. Consequently, whether or not petitioner resigned has to be determined from his act and omissions before, during and after January 20, 2001 or by the totality of prior, contemporaneous and posterior facts and circumstantial evidence bearing a material relevance on the issue.

            Using this totality test, we hold that petitioner resigned as President. To appreciate the public pressure that led to the resignation of the petitioner, it is important to follow the succession of events after the exposé of Governor Singson. The Senate Blue petitioner's alleged misgovernance in the Blue Ribbon investigation Ribbon Committee investigated. The more detailed revelations of petitioner's alleged misgovernance in the Blue Ribbon investigation spiked the hate against him. The Articles of Impeachment filed cipher chance of succeeding snowballed. In express speed, it in the House of Representatives which initially was given a near gained the signatures of 115 representatives or more than 1/3 of the House of Representatives. Soon, petitioner's powerful political allies began deserting him. Respondent Arroyo quit as Secretary of Social Welfare. Senate President Drilon and former Speaker Villar defected with 47 representatives in tow. Then, his respected senior economic advisers resigned together with his Secretary of Trade and Industry.

            According to Secretary Angara, he asked Senator Pimentel to advise petitioner to consider the option of "dignified exit or resignation." Petitioner did not disagree but listened intently. The sky was falling fast on the petitioner. At 9:30 p.m., Senator Pimentel repeated to the petitioner the urgency of making a graceful and dignified exit. He gave the proposal a sweetener by saying that petitioner would be allowed to go abroad with enough funds to support him and his family. Significantly, the petitioner expressed no objection to the suggestion for a graceful and dignified exit but said he would never leave the country. At 10:00 p.m., petitioner revealed to Secretary Angara, "Ed, Angie (Reyes) guaranteed that I would have five days to a week in the palace." This is proof that petitioner had reconciled himself to the reality that he had to resign. His mind was already concerned with the five-day grace period he could stay in the palace. It was a matter of time.

            In sum, we hold that the resignation of the petitioner cannot be doubted. It was confirmed by his leaving Malacañang. In the press release containing his final statement, (1) he acknowledged the oath-taking of the respondent as President of the Republic albeit with reservation about its legality; (2) he emphasized he was leaving the Palace, the seat of the presidency, for the sake of peace and in order to begin the healing process of our nation. He did not say he was leaving the Palace due to any kind [of] inability and that he was going to re-assume the presidency as soon as the disability disappears; (3) he expressed his gratitude to the people for the opportunity to serve them. Without doubt, he was referring to the past opportunity given him to serve the people as President; (4) he assured that he will not shirk from any future challenge that may is to a future challenge after occupying the office of the president come ahead in the same service of our country. Petitioner's reference and (5) he called on his supporters to join him in the promotion of a constructive national spirit of reconciliation and solidarity. Certainly, the national spirit of reconciliation a The press release was petitioner's valedictory, his final act of solidarity could not be attained if he did not give up the presidency, farewell. His presidency is now in the past tense. (Estrada u. Arroyo, G.R. No. 146738, March 2, 2001)

            """<b>Legislative Powers of the President</b>
            Proclamation No. 1716 was issued by the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos on February 17, 1978 in the due exercise of legislative power vested upon him by Amendment No. 6 introduced in 1976. Being a valid act of legislation, said Proclamation may only be amended by an equally valid act of legislation. Proclamation No. 164 is obviously not a valid act of legislation. After the so-called bloodless revolution of February 1986, President Corazon Aquino took the reins of power under a revolutionary government. On March 24, 1986, she issued her historic Proclamation No. 3, promulgating the Provisional Constitution, or more popularly referred to as the Freedom Constitution. Under Article II, Section 1 of the Freedom Constitution, the President shall continue to exercise legislative power until a legislature is elected and convened under a new constitution. Then came the ratification of the draft constitution, to be known later as the 1987 Constitution. When Congress was convened on July 26, 1987, President Aquino lost this legislative power under the Freedom Constitution. Proclamation No. 164, amending Proclamation No. 1716 was issued on October 6, 1987 when legislative power was already solely on Congress. (Municipality of San Juan v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125183, September 29, 1997)

            The line that delineates Legislative and Executive power is not indistinct. Legislative power is "the authority, under the Constitution, to make laws, and to alter and repeal them." The Constitution, as the will of the people in their original, sovereign and unlimited capacity, has vested this power in the Congress of the Philippines. The grant of legislative power to Congress is broad, general and comprehensive. The legislative body possesses plenary power for all purposes of civil government. Any power, deemed to be legislative by usage and tradition, is necessarily possessed by except as limited by the Constitution, either expressly or impliedly. Congress, unless the Constitution has lodged it elsewhere. In fine, legislative power embraces all subjects and extends to matters of general concern or common interest.

            While Congress is vested with the power to enact laws, the President executes the laws. The executive power is vested in the Presidents. It is generally defined as the power to enforce and administer the laws. It is the power of carrying the laws into practical operation and enforcing their due observance. (Ople v. Torres, G.R. No 127685, July 23, 1998)
            """,
            """<b>Power to Prosecute Crimes</b> 
            In truth, the prosecution of crimes appertains to the executive department of government whose principal power and responsibility is to see that our laws are faithfully executed. A necessary component of this power to execute our laws is the right to prosecute their violators. The right to prosecute vests the prosecutor with a wide range of discretion the discretion of whether, what and whom to charge, the exercise of which depends on a smorgasbord of factors which are best appreciated by prosecutors. We thus hold that it is not constitutionally impermissible for Congress to enact Republic Act No. 6981 vesting in the Department of Justice the power to determine who can qualify as a witness in the program and who shall be granted immunity from prosecution. Section 9 of Rule 119 does not support the proposition that the power to choose who shall be a state witness is an inherent judicial prerogative. Under this provision, the court is given the power to discharge a state witness only because it has already acquired jurisdiction over the crime and the accused.

            The discharge of an accused is part of the exercise of jurisdiction but is not a recognition of an inherent judicial function. Moreover, the Rules of Court have never been interpreted to be beyond change by legislation designed to improve the administration of our justice system. Republic Act No. 6981 is one of the much sought penal reform laws to help the government in its uphill fight against crime, one certain cause of which is the reticence of witnesses to testify. The rationale for the law is well put by the Department of Justice, viz.: "Witnesses, for fear of reprisal and economic dislocation, usually refuse to appear and testify in the investigation/prosecution of criminal complaints/cases. Because of such refusal, criminal lack of evidence. For a more effective administration of criminal complaints/cases have been dismissed for insufficiency and/or justice, there was a necessity to pass a law protecting witnesses and granting them certain rights and benefits to ensure their appearance in investigative bodies/courts." Petitioner Webb's challenge to the validity of Republic Act No. 6981 cannot therefore succeed. (Webb v. De Leon, G.R. No. 121234, August 23, 1995)

            Notes:
            Under Section 16, Article VII of the Constitution, the President appoints all officials and employees in the Executive branch whose appointments are vested in the President by the Constitution or by law. The President also appoints those whose appointments are not otherwise provided by law. Under this Section 16, the law may also authorize the "heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards" to appoint officers lower in rank than such heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards.

            Under Section 16, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, the President appoints three groups of officers. The first group refers to the heads of the Executive departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in the President by the Constitution. The second group refers to those whom the President may be authorized by law to appoint. The third group refers to all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided by law.

            Under the same Section 16, there is a fourth group of lower. the heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards. In a ranked officers whose appointments Congress may by law vest in department in the Executive branch, the head is the Secretary.

            The law may not authorize the Undersecretary, acting as such Undersecretary, to appoint lower-ranked officers in the Executive department. In an agency, the power is vested in the head of the agency for it would be preposterous to vest it in the agency itself. In a commission, the head is the chairperson of the commission. In a board, the head is also the chairperson of the board. In the last three situations, the law may not also authorize officers other than the heads of the agency, commission, or board to appoint lower-ranked officers. (Liban v. Gordon, G.R. No. 175352, July 15, 2009)
            """,
            """<b>Classes of Appointment</b>
            It is readily apparent that under the provisions of the 1987 Constitution, just quoted, there are four groups of officers whom the President shall appoint. These groups, to which we will hereafter refer from time to time, are:

            <b>First,</b> the heads of the executive departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in him in this Constitution;

            <b>Second,</b> all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law;

            <b>Third,</b> those whom the President may be authorized by law to appoint;

            <b>Fourth,</b> officers lower in rank whose appointments the Congress may by law vest in the President alone.

            The first group of officers is clearly appointed with the consent of the Commission on Appointments. Appointments of such officers are initiated by nomination and, if the nomination is confirmed by the Commission on Appointments, the President appoints.

            The second, third, and fourth groups of officers are the present bone of contention. Should they be appointed by the President with or without the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on Appointments? By following the accepted rule in constitutional and statutory construction that an express enumeration of subjects excludes others not enumerated, it would follow that only those the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on Appointments. appointments to positions expressly stated in the first group require But we need not rely solely on this basic rule of constitutional construction. We can refer to historical background as well as to the records of the 1986 Constitutional Commission to determine, with more accuracy, if not precision, the intention of the framers of the 1987 Constitution and the people adopting it, on whether the groups, require the consent (confirmation) of the Commission on appointments by the President, under the second, third, and fourth Appointments.

            In the 1987 Constitution, however, as already pointed out, the clear and expressed intent of its framers was to exclude presidential appointments from confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, except appointments to offices expressly mentioned in the first sentence of Section 16, Article VII. Consequently, there was no reason to use in the third sentence of Section 16, Article VII the word "alone" after the word "President" in providing that Congress may by law vest the appointment of lower-ranked officers in the President alone, or in the courts, or in the heads of departments because the power to appoint officers whom he (the President) may be authorized by law to appoint is already vested in the President, without need of confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, in the second sentence of the same Section 16, Article VII.

            Therefore, the third sentence of Section 16, Article VII could have stated merely that, in the case of lower-ranked officers, the Congress may by law vest their appointment in the President, in the courts, or in the heads of various departments of the government. In short, the word "alone" in the third sentence of Section 16, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, as a literal import from the last part of paragraph 3, Section 10, Article VII of the 1935 Constitution, appears to be redundant in the light of the second sentence of Section 16, Article VII. And, this redundancy cannot prevail over the clear and positive intent of the framers of the 1987 Constitution that presidential appointments, except those mentioned in the first sentence of Section 16, Article VII, are not subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments. (Sarmiento v. Mison, G.R. No. 79974, December 17, 1987)

            The Legislative can create office, but only Executive can fill it; Congress cannot circumvent this by setting very narrow qualifications, such that only one person is qualified to hold office. (Flores v. Drilon, G.R. No. 104732, June 22, 1993)

            """<b>Appointments to Philippine National Police</b> 
            The Philippine National Police is separate and distinct from the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The Constitution, no less, sets forth the distinction.

It shall keep a regular force of a citizen armed force which shall undergo military training and necessary for the security of the State." The police force shall be organized, trained and equipped primarily for the performance of police functions. Its national scope and civilian character shall be paramount. No element of the police force shall be military, nor shall any position thereof be occupied by active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

The fact that it is subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments does not alter its permanent character. The Constitution itself makes an ad interim appointment permanent in character by making it effective until disapproved by the Commission on Appointments or until the next adjournment of Congress.

            Thus, the ad interim appointment remains effective until such disapproval or next adjournment, signifying that it can no longer be withdrawn or revoked by the President. The fear that the President can withdraw or revoke at any time and for any reason an ad interim appointment is utterly without basis.

            """<b>Temporary Appointment</b> 
            A temporary appointment is defined as "one made in an acting capacity, the essence of which lies in its temporary character and its terminability at pleasure by the appointing power." Thus, the temporary appointee accepts the position with the condition that he shall surrender the office when called upon to do so by the appointing authority. The termination of a temporary appointment may be with or without a cause since the appointee serves merely at the pleasure of the appointing authority.

            In the career executive service, the acquisition of security of tenure presupposes a permanent appointment. As held in General Roco, two requisites must concur in order that an employee in the career executive service may attain security of tenure, to wit: 1) CES eligibility and 2) appointment to the appropriate CES rank.

            The President shall have the power to make appointments during the recess of the Congress, whether voluntary or a compulsory, but such appointments shall be effective only until disapproval by the Commission on Appointments or until the next adjournment of the Congress.

            Ad interim appointments must be distinguished from appointments in an acting capacity. Both of them are effective upon acceptance. But ad interim appointments are extended only during a recess of Congress, whereas acting appointments may be extended any time there is a vacancy. Moreover, ad interim appointments a submitted to the Commission on Appointments for confirmation or rejection; acting appointments are not submitted to the Commission on Appointments. Acting appointments are a way of temporarily filling important offices but, if abused, they can also be a way of circumventing the need for confirmation by the Commission on Appointments.

            <b>Notes:</b> 
            The case of Aytona defined "midnight or last minute" appointments for Philippine jurisprudence. President Carlos P. Garcia submitted on December 29,1961, his last day in office, 350 appointments, including that of Dominador R. Aytona for Central Bank Governor. President Diosdado P. Macapagal assumed office on December 30,1961, and issued on December 31, 1961 Administrative Order No. 2 recalling, withdrawing, and cancelling all appointments made by President Garcia after December 13, 1961 (President Macapagal's proclamation date). President Macapagal appointed Andres V. Castillo as Central Bank Governor on January 1, 1962. This Court dismissed Aytona's quo warranto proceeding against the "midnight or last minute" appointments.

            """<b>Midnight Appointment Prohibition Is Not Applicable in the Judiciary</b> 
            The Supreme Court ruled in De Castro v. Judicial and Bar Council, that the prohibition under Section 15, Article VII does not apply to appointments to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court or to other appointments to the Judiciary. As can be seen, Article VII is devoted to the Executive Department, and, among others, it lists the powers vested by the Constitution in the President. The presidential power of appointment is dealt with in Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Article.

            Article VIII is dedicated to the Judicial Department and defines the duties and qualifications of Members of the Supreme Court, among others. Section 4(1) and Section 9 of this Article are the provisions specifically providing for the appointment of Supreme Court Justices. In particular, Section 9 states that the appointment of Supreme Court Justices can only be made by the President upon the submission of a list of at least three nominees by the JBC; Section 4(1) of the Article mandates the President to fill the vacancy within 90 days from the occurrence of the vacancy. (De Castro v. Judicial and Bar Council, G.R. No. 191002, March 17, 2010)

            Moreover, in the decision on the motion for reconsideration of the case of De Castro v. Judicial and Bar Council, the Supreme Court ruled that the movants take the majority to task for holding that Section 15, Article VII does not apply to appointments in the Judiciary. They aver that the Court either ignored or refused to apply many principles of statutory construction. The movants gravely err in their posture and are themselves apparently contravening their avowed reliance on the principles of statutory construction. For one, the movants, disregarding the absence from Section 15, Article VII of the express extension of the ban on appointments to the Judiciary, insist that the ban applied to the Judiciary under the principle of verba legis. That is self-contradiction at its worst.

            Had the framers intended to extend the prohibition contained in Section 15, Article VII to the appointment of Members of the Supreme Court, they could have explicitly done so. They could not have ignored the meticulous ordering of the provisions. They would have easily and surely written the prohibition made explicit in Section 15, Article VII as being equally applicable to the appointment of Members of the Supreme Court in Article VIII itself, most likely in Section 4 (1), Article VIII. That such specification w Acting President making appointments within two months befors not done only reveals that the prohibition against the President the next presidential elections and up to the end of the Presidents or Acting President's term does not refer to the Members of the to be stretched to any unintended point in order to suit the purpos Supreme Court.

            """<b>Power of Removal</b>
            While the Ombudsman's authority to discipline administratively is extensive and covers all government officials, whether appointive or elective, with the exception only of those officials removable by impeachment, the members of congress and the judiciary, such authority is by no means exclusive. Petitioners cannot insist that they should be solely and directly subject to the disciplinary authority of the Ombudsman. For, while Section 21 declares the Ombudsman's disciplinary authority over all government officials, Section 8(2), on the other hand, grants the President express power of removal over a Deputy Ombudsman and a Special Prosecutor.

            While the removal of the Ombudsman himself is also expressly provided for in the Constitution, which is by impeachment under Section 24 of the same Article, there is, however, no constitutional provision similarly dealing with the removal from office of a Deputy Ombudsman, or a Special Prosecutor, for that matter. By enacting Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770, Congress simply filled a gap in the law without running afoul of any provision in the Constitution or existing statutes. In fact, the Constitution itself, under Section 2, authorizes Congress to provide for the removal of all other public officers, including the Deputy Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor who are not subject to impeachment. (Gonzales v. Office of the President, G.R. No. 196231, September 4, 2012)
            """,
            """<b>Independence of the Ombudsman</b> 
            The 1987 Constitution created a new, independent Office of the Ombudsman. The existing Tanodbayan at the time became the Office of the Special Prosecutor under the 1987 Constitution. While the composition of the independent Office of the Ombudsman under the 1987 Constitution does not textually include the Special Prosecutor, the weight of the foregoing discussions on the unconstitutionality of Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 should equally apply to the Special Prosecutor on the basis of the legislative history of the Office of the Ombudsman as expounded in jurisprudence.

            In the voting held on January 28, 2014, by a vote of 8-7, the Court resolved to reverse its September 4, 2012 decision in so far as petitioner Gonzales is concerned (G.R. No. 196231). We declared Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 unconstitutional by granting in violation of the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman.

            However, by another vote of 8-7, the Court resolved to maintain the validity of Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 insofar as Sulit is concerned. The Court did not consider the Office of the Special Prosecutor to be constitutionally within the Office of the Ombudsman and is, hence, not entitled to the independence the latter enjoys under the Constitution.

            WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court resolves to declare Section 8(2) UNCONSTITUTIONAL. This ruling renders any further ruling on the dismissal of Deputy Ombudsman Emilio Gonzales III unnecessary, but is without prejudice to the power of the Ombudsman to conduct an administrative investigation, if warranted, into the possible administrative liability of Deputy Ombudsman Emilio Gonzales III under pertinent Civil Service laws, rules and regulations.

            The President shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices. He shall ensure that the laws be faithfully executed. (Section 17, Article VII)

            Control is essentially the power to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former with that of the latter. Clearly, the power of control is entirely different from the power to create public offices. The former is inherent in the Executive, while the latter finds basis from either a valid delegation from Congress or his inherent duty to faithfully execute the laws.(Biraogo v. Truth Commission of 2010, G.R. No. 192935, December 7, 2010) 

            To begin with, one need only refer to the fundamentally accepted principle in Constitutional Law that the President has control of all executive departments, bureaus, and offices to lay at rest petitioner's contention on the matter. This presidential power of control over the executive branch of government extends over all executive officers from Cabinet Secretary to the lowliest clerk and has been held by us, in the landmark case of Mondano v. Silvosa, to mean "the power of the President to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former with that of the latter." It is said to be at the very "heart of the meaning of Chief Executive." Thus, and in short, "the President's power of control is directly exercised by him over the members of the Cabinet who, in turn, and by his authority, control the bureaus and other offices under their respective jurisdictions in the executive department." (Carpio v. The Executive Secretary, G.R. No. 96409, February 14, 1992)

            As the Executive in whom the executive power is vested, the primary function of the President is to enforce the laws as well as to formulate policies to be embodied in existing laws. He sees to it that all laws are enforced by the officials and employees of his department. Before assuming office, he is required to take an oath or affirmation to the effect that as President of the Philippines, he will, among others, "execute its laws." In the exercise of such function, the President, if needed, may employ the powers attached to his office as the Commander-in-Chief of all the armed forces of the country, including the Philippine National Police under the Department of Interior and Local Government.
            """,
            """<b>Control vs. Supervision</b>
            An officer in control lays down the rules in the doing of an act. If they are not followed, he may, in his discretion, order the act undone or re-done by his subordinate or he may even decide to do it himself. Supervision does not cover such authority. The supervisor or superintendent merely sees to it that the rules are followed, but he himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, he may order the work done or re-done but only to conform to the prescribed rules. He may not prescribe his own manner for the doing of the act. He has no judgment on this matter except to see to it that the rules are followed. (Drilon v. Lim, G.R. No. 112497, August 4, 1994)

            """<b>Alter-ego Principle or Doctrine of Qualified Political Agency</b> 
            This doctrine states that all executive and administrative are adjuncts of the Executive Department, the heads organizations of the various executive departments are assistants and agents of the Chief Executive, and except in cases where the Chief Executive is required by the Constitution or the law to act in person or the exigencies of the situation demand that he act personally, the multifarious executive and administrative functions of the Chief performed by and through the executive departments, Executive are and the acts of the secretaries of such departments, performed and promulgated in the regular course of business are, unless disapproved or reprobated by the Chief Executive, presumptively the acts of the Chief Executive.

            As a matter of executive policy, they may be granted departmental autonomy as to certain matters but this is by mere concession of the executive, in the absence of valid legislation in the particular field. If the President, then, is the authority in the Executive Department, he assumes the corresponding responsibility. The head of a department is a man of his confidence; he controls and directs his acts; he appoints him and can remove him at pleasure; he is the executive, not any of his secretaries. It is therefore logical that he, the President, should be answerable for the acts of administration of the entire Executive Department before his own conscience no less than before that undefined power of public opinion which, in the language of Daniel Webster, is the last repository of popular government. These are the necessary corollaries of the American presidential type of government, and if there is any defect, it is attributable to the system itself. We cannot modify the system unless we modify the Constitution, and we cannot modify the Constitution by any subtle process of judicial interpretation or constitution. (Villena v. The Secretary of Interior, G.R. No. L-46570, April 21, 1939)

            Under the doctrine of qualified political agency, department secretaries are alter egos or assistants of the President and their acts are presumed to be those of the latter unless disapproved or reprobated by him. Thus, as a rule, an aggrieved party affected by the decision of a cabinet secretary need not appeal to the Office of the President and may file a petition for certiorari directly in the Court of Appeals assailing the act of the said secretary. (Manubay v. Garilao, G.R. No. 140717, April 16, 2009)

            Equally well accepted, as a corollary rule to the control powers of the President, is the "Doctrine of Qualified Political Agency." As the President cannot be expected to exercise his control powers all at the same time and in person, he will have to delegate some of them to his Cabinet members. Under this doctrine, which recognizes the establishment of a single executive, "all executive and administrative organizations are adjuncts of the Executive Department, the heads of the various executive departments are assistants and agents of the Chief Executive, and, except in cases where the Chief Executive is required by the Constitution or law to act in person on the exigencies of the situation demand that he acts personally, the multifarious executive and administrative functions of the Chief Executive are performed by and through the executive departments, and the acts of the Secretaries of such departments, performed and promulgated in the regular course of business, unless disapproved or reprobated by the Chief Executive presumptively the acts of the Chief Executive."

While he may issue advisories and seek their cooperation in solving economic difficulties, he cannot prevent them from performing their tasks and using available resources to achieve their goals.

            It is correct to say that constitutional powers are those which the President must exercise in person. It is not correct, however, to say that the Chief Executive may not delegate to his Executive Secretary acts which the Constitution does not command that he performs in person. Reason is not wanting for this view. The President is not expected to perform in person all the multifarious executive and administrative functions. The Office of the Executive Secretary is an auxiliary unit which assists the President. The rule which has thus gained recognition is that "under our constitutional setup, the Executive Secretary who acts for and in behalf and by authority of the President has an undisputed jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or even reverse any order" that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, including the Director of Lands, may issue. The assumed authority of the Executive Secretary is to be accepted. For, only the President may rightfully say that the Executive Secretary is not authorized to do so. Therefore, unless the action taken is "disapproved or reprobated by the Chief Executive," that remains the act of the Chief Executive, and cannot be successfully assailed. (Lacson-Magallanes v.

Within 48 hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress.

            """<b>Commander-in-Chief Clause</b> 
            In American political realm, the clause has two separate but related purposes: First, in response to the charge in the Declaration of Independence that the King had "affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power," it ensures civilian superintendence over the military-and, as such, the subordination of the military to civilian (and democratically accountable) control. Second, and in contrast to the experience under the Articles of Confederation, it places such civilian superintendence in the hands of a single person.

            The propriety of admitting the president to be commander-in- chief, so far as to give orders, and have a general superintendency, was admitted. But it was urged, that it would be dangerous to let him command in person, without any restraint, as he might make a bad use of it. The consent of both houses of Congress ought, therefore, to be required, before he should take the actual command. The answer then given was, that though the president might, there was no necessity that he should, take the command in person; and there was no probability that he would do so, except in military talents. (https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/ extraordinary emergencies, and when he was possessed of superior article-2/section-2/clause-1/commander-in-chief/ - accessed date: 10/16/2020)

            The Constitution grants the President, as Commander-in- Chief, a "sequence" of graduated powers. From the most to the least benign, these are: the calling-out power, the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the power to declare Martial Law. Citing Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora, the Court ruled that the only criterion for the exercise of the calling- eut power is that "whenever it becomes necessary," the President invasion or rebellion." Are these conditions present in the instant nay call the armed forces "to prevent or suppress lawless violence, cases? As stated earlier, considering the circumstances then prevailing, President Arroyo found it necessary to issue PP 1017. Owing to her Office's vast intelligence network, she is in the best position to determine the actual condition of the country. (David v. Arroyo, G.R. No. 171396, May 3, 2006)

            Under this instance, the President, to repeat, abdicates nothing of his war powers. It would bear to here state, in reiteration of the preponderant view, that the President, as Commander-in-Chief, is not a member of the Armed Forces. He remains a civilian whose duties under the Commander-in-Chief provision "represent only a part of the organic duties imposed upon him. All his other functions are clearly civil in nature." His position as a civilian Commander- in-Chief is consistent with, and a testament to, the constitutional principle that "civilian authority is, at all times, supreme over the military."

            """<b>Graduated Military Powers</b>
            Indeed, the 1987 Constitution gives the "President, as Commander-in-Chief, a 'sequence' of 'graduated powers.' From the most to the least benign, these are: the calling out power, the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the power to declare martial law." It must be stressed, however, that the graduation refers only to hierarchy based on scope and effect. It does not in any manner refer to a sequence, arrangement, or order which the Commander-in-Chief must follow. This so-called "graduation of powers" does not dictate or restrict the manner by which the President decides which power to choose.

            These extraordinary powers are conferred by the Constitution with the President as Commander-in-Chief; it therefore necessarily follows that the power and prerogative to determine whether the situation warrants a mere exercise of the calling out power; or whether the situation demands suspension of the privilege of of martial law, also lies, at least initially, with the President. The the writ of habeas corpus; or whether it calls for the declaration to wield in a given set of conditions is a judgment call on the part power to choose, initially, which among these extraordinary powers of the President. As Commander-in-Chief, his powers are broad enough to include his prerogative to address exigencies or threats that endanger the government and the very integrity of the State.

            It is thus beyond doubt that the power of judicial review does not extend to calibrating the President's decision pertaining to which extraordinary power to avail given a set of facts or conditions. To do so would be tantamount to an incursion into the exclusive domain of the Executive and an infringement on the prerogative that solely, at least initially, lies with the President. (Lagman v.

            Under the calling-out power, the President may summon the armed forces to aid him in suppressing lawless violence, invasion, and rebellion. This involves ordinary police action. But every act that goes beyond the President's calling-out power is considered illegal or ultra vires. For this reason, a President must be careful in the exercise of his powers. He cannot invoke a greater power when he wishes to act under a lesser power. There lies the wisdom of our Constitution, the greater the power, the greater are the limitations. (David v. Arroyo, G.R.

            In the case at bar, the bone of contention concerns the factual determination of the President of the necessity of calling the armed forces, particularly the Marines, to aid the PNP in visibility patrols. In this regard, the IBP admits that the deployment of the military personnel falls under the Commander-in-Chief powers of the President as stated in Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution. specifically, the power to call out the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. What the IBP questions, however, is the basis for the calling of the Marines under the aforestated provision. According to the IBP, no emergency exists that would justify the need for the calling of the military to assist the police force. It contends that no lawless violence, invasion, or rebellion exists to warrant the calling of the Marines. Thus, the IBP prays that this Court "review the sufficiency of the factual basis for said troop [Marine] deployment."

            The deployment of the Marines does not constitute a breach of the civilian supremacy clause. The calling of the Marines in this enforcement. The participation of the Marines in the conduct of case constitutes permissible use of military assets for civilian law joint visibility patrols is appropriately circumscribed. The limited participation of the Marines is evident in the provisions of the LOI itself, which sufficiently provides the metes and bounds of the Marines' authority. It is noteworthy that the local police forces authority belonging to the PNP. In fact, the Metro Manila Police are the ones in charge of the visibility patrols at all times, the real Chief is the overall leader of the PNP-Philippine Marines joint visibility patrols. Under the LOI, the police forces are tasked to brief or orient the soldiers on police patrol procedures. It is their responsibility to direct and manage the deployment of the Marines. It is, likewise, their duty to provide the necessary equipment to the Marines and render logistical support to these soldiers. In view of the foregoing, it cannot be properly argued that military authority supreme over civilian authority. Moreover, the deployment of the Marines to assist the PNP does not unmake the civilian character of the police force. Neither does it amount to an "insidious incursion" of the military in the task of law enforcement in violation of Section 5(4), Article XVI of the Constitution. (IBP v. Zamora, G.R.

The distinction places the calling out power in a different category from the power to declare martial law and the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, otherwise, the framers of the Constitution would have simply lumped together the three powers and provided for their revocation and review without any qualification.

            In other words, the President may exercise the power to call out the Armed Forces independently of the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and to declare martial law, although, of course, it may also be a prelude to a possible future exercise of the latter powers, as in this case. Even so ,the Court's review of the President's declaration of martial law and his calling out the Armed Forces necessarily entails separate proceedings instituted for that particular purpose.

            """<b>Declaration of Martial Law</b>
            Martial law, also called martial rule is a type of jurisdiction in which military authority temporarily replaces civil authority. As stated in the 1998 case of Mudd v. Caldera, martial law authorizes the military to exercise the responsibilities of branches who are unable to function, such as the legislature, executive branch, or the courts. This is usually in response to war, natural disaster, or civil unrest, and is limited to such times of emergency; as such, at the conclusion of the instigating circumstance, martial law must end and the civil authority resumed. Martial law has been declared several countries throughout history, recently in Ukraine and the Philippines. (https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/martial law/- accessed date: 10/16/2020)

            A state of martial law is peculiar because the President, at such a time, exercises police power, which is normally a function of the Legislature. In particular, the President exercises police power, with the military's assistance, to ensure public safety and in place of government agencies which for the time being are unable to cope with the condition in a locality, which remains under the control of the State.

            The President as Commander-in-Chief may order the "(a) arrests and seizures without judicial warrants; (b) ban on public assemblies; (c) takeover of news media and agencies and press censorship; and (d) issuance of Presidential Decrees."

            Worthy to note, however, that the above-cited acts that the President may perform do not give him unbridled discretion to infringe on the rights of civilians during martial law. This is because martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, neither does it supplant the operation of civil courts or legislative assemblies. Moreover, the guarantees under the Bill of Rights remain in place during its pendency. And in such instance where the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is also suspended, such suspension applies only to those judicially charged with rebellion or offenses connected with invasion. Clearly, from the foregoing, while martial law poses the most severe threat to civil liberties, the Constitution has safeguards against the President's prerogative to declare a state of martial law. (Lagman v. Medialdea, G.R. No. 231658, July 4, 2017)

            A declaration of martial law does not suspend fundamental civil rights of individuals as the Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution remain effective. Civil courts and legislative bodies remain open. While it is recognized that, in the declaration of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the powers given to officials tasked with its implementation are susceptible to abuses, these instances have already been taken into consideration when the pertinent provisions on martial law were drafted. Safeguards within the 1987 Constitution and existing laws are available to protect the people from these abuses. (Lagman Medialdea, G.R. No. 243522, February 19, 2019)

            """<b>Requisites for the Declaration of Martial Law</b> 
            In order to declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the Constitution requires the following:

            (a) The President may declare martial law or suspend of the privilege of the writ of the privilege of habeas corpus only when there is an invasion or rebellion and public safety requires such declaration or suspension.

            (b) The President's proclamation or suspension shall be for a period not exceeding 60 days.

            (c) Within 48 hours from the proclamation or suspension, the President must submit a Report in person or in writing to Congress.

            (d) The Congress, voting jointly and by a vote of at least a majority of all its members, can revoke the proclamation or suspension. 

            (e) The President cannot set aside the Congress' revocation of his proclamation or suspension

            (f) The President cannot, by himself, extend his proclamation or suspension. He should ask the Congress' approval.

            (g) Upon such initiative or request from the President, the Congress, voting jointly and by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members, can extend the proclamation or suspension for such period as it may determine.

            (h) The extension of the proclamation or suspension shall only be approved when the invasion or rebellion persists and public safety requires it.

            (i) The Supreme Court may review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or suspension, or the extension thereof, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen.

            (j) The Supreme Court must promulgate its decision within 30 days from the filing of the appropriate proceeding.

            (k) Martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution.

            Accordingly, the Bill of Rights remains effective under a state of martial law. Its implementers must adhere to the principle that civilian authority is supreme over the military and the armed forces are the protector of the people. They must also abide by the State's policy to value the dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights.

            (l) Martial law does not supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function.

            (m) The suspension of the privilege of the writ applies only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with invasion.

            (n) Finally, during the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained should be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he should be released. (Lagman v. Pimentel, III, G.R. No. 235935, February 6, 2018)

            """<b>Extension of Martial Law</b> 
            The records of the Constitutional Commission show that Commissioner Suarez's proposal to add a similar 60-day limitation to the extension of an initial proclamation of martial law was not adopted by a majority of the members of the Commission. The framers evidently gave enough flexibility on Congress to determine the duration of the extension.

            The Constitutional limits/checks set by the Constitution to guard against the whimsical or arbitrary use of the extraordinary powers of the Chief Executive under Section 18, Article VII are well  in place and are working. At the initial declaration of the martial to report law, the President observed the 60-day limit and the requirement to Congress. In this initial declaration as well as in the extensions, the President's decision was based on the reports prepared by the different specialized agencies of the Executive branch charged with external and internal security of the whole country. These were the same reports submitted to Congress which were deliberated on, no matter how brief the time allotment was for each of the lawmakers' interpellations. Yet the evidence or basis to support the extension of martial law passed through the scrutiny of the Chief Executive and through several more of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Court must remember that we are called upon to rule on whether the President, and this time with the concurrence of the two Houses of Congress, acted with sufficient basis in approving anew the extension of martial law. We must not fall into or be tempted to substitute our own judgment to that of the People's President and the People's representatives. We must not forget that the Constitution has given us separate and quite distinct roles to fill up in our respective branches of government. (Lagman v. Medialdea, G.R. No. 243522, February 19, 2019)

            """<b>Military Tribunals</b>
            Trying citizens in military courts is unconstitutional when civilian courts are still operating. Trial by military tribunal is constitutional only when there is no power left but the military, and the military may validly try criminals only as long as it is absolutely necessary.  (Ex-Party Milligan, 71 U.S. 2[1866])

            Moreover, military tribunals pertain to the Executive Department of the Government and are simply instrumentalities of the executive power, provided by the legislature for the President as Commander-in-Chief to aid him in properly commanding the army and navy and enforcing discipline therein, and utilized under his orders or those of his authorized military representatives. (Olaguer v. Military Commission No. 34, G.R. No. L-54558, May 22, 1987)

            """<b>Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus</b> 
             A writ of habeas corpus (which literally means to "produce the body") is a court order demanding that a public official (such as a warden) deliver an imprisoned individual to the court and show a valid reason for that person's detention. (https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/writ-of-habeas-corpus/- accessed date:  10/17/2020)

             This provision of the act of Congress makes two conditions necessary in order that the President or the Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. They are as follows: (1) When there exists rebellion, insurrection, or invasion; and (2) When public safety may require it. In other words, in order that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended, there must exist rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, and the public safety must require it. (Barcelon v. Baker, G.R. No. 2808, September 30, 1905)

             The authority to decide whenever the exigency has arisen requiring the suspension belongs to the President and "his decision is final and conclusive" upon the courts and upon all other persons. (Montenegro v. Castañeda, G.R. No. L-4221, August 30, 1952)

             Indeed, the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute nor unqualified. The authority conferred by the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive Department, is limited and conditional. The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as an exception thereto. What is more, it postulates the former in the negative, evidently to stress its importance, by providing that "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended...." It is only by way of exception that it permits the suspension of the privilege.

             Far from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined, and restricted, not only by the prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but, also, as regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised. These factors and the aforementioned setting or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the limitations of said power, beyond which it does not exist. And, like the limitations and restrictions imposed by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by courts of justice.  Otherwise, the explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless. Surely, the framers of our Constitution could not have intended to engage in such a wasteful exercise in futility.

            """<b>Pardoning Power</b> 
            Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.

            He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress. (Section 19, Article VII)

            Pardon is defined as "an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the Court. A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance." (Monsanto v. Factoran, G.R. No. 78239, February 9, 1989)

            The pardoning power of the President cannot be limited by legislative action. The 1987 Constitution, specifically Section 19 of Article VII and Section 5 of Article IX-C, provides that the President of the Philippines possesses the power to grant pardons, along with other acts of executive clemency...

            It is apparent from the foregoing constitutional provisions that the only instances in which the President may not extend pardon remain to be in: (1) impeachment cases; (2) cases that have not yet resulted in a final conviction; and (3) cases involving violations of election laws, rules, and regulations in which there was no favorable recommendation coming from the COMELEC. Therefore, it can be argued that any act of Congress by way of statute cannot operate to delimit the pardoning power of the President.

            A pardon, being a presidential prerogative, should not be circumscribed by legislative action. Thus, it is unmistakably the long standing position of this Court that the exercise of the pardoning power is discretionary in the President and may not be interfered with by Congress or the Court, except only when it exceeds the limits provided for by the Constitution.

            This doctrine of non-diminution or non-impairment of the President's power of pardon by acts of Congress, specifically through legislation, was strongly adhered to by an overwhelming majority of the framers of the 1987 Constitution when they flatly rejected a proposal to carve out an exception from the pardoning power of the President in the form of "offenses involving graft and corruption" that would be enumerated and defined by Congress through the enactment of a law.

            Whether or not a public officer, who has been granted an absolute pardon by the Chief Executive, is entitled to reinstatement to her former position without need of a new appointment.

            A pardon looks to the future. It is not retrospective. It makes no amends for the past. It affords no relief for what has been suffered by the offender. It does not impose upon the government any obligation to make reparation for what has been suffered. "Since the offense has been established by judicial proceedings, that which has been done or suffered while they were in force is presumed to have been rightfully done and justly suffered, and no satisfaction for it can be required." This would explain why petitioner, though pardoned. cannot be entitled to receive backpay for lost earnings and benefits.

            Pardon cannot mask the acts constituting the crime. These are "historical" facts which, despite the public manifestation of mercy and forgiveness implicit in pardon, "ordinary, prudent men will take into account in their subsequent dealings with the actor."

            Pardon granted after conviction frees the individual from all rights. But unless expressly grounded on the person's innocence the penalties and legal disabilities and restores him to all his civil (which is rare), it cannot bring back lost reputation for honesty, integrity and fair dealing. This must be constantly kept in mind lest we lose track of the true character and purpose of the privilege. (Monsanto v. Factoran, G.R. No. 78239, February 9, 1989)

            """<b>Pardon Is Forgiveness Not Forgetfulness</b> 
            The very essence of a pardon is forgiveness or remission of guilt and not forgetfulness. It does not erase the fact of the commission from all the penalties and legal disabilities and restores to him of the crime and the conviction thereof. Pardon frees the individual innocence, it cannot bring back lost reputation for honesty, integrity all his civil rights. Unless expressly grounded on the person's appointment to public office which was forfeited by reason of the and fair dealing. The pardoned offender regains his eligibility for conviction of the offense. But since pardon does not generally result in automatic reinstatement because the offender has to apply for reappointment, he is not entitled to back wages.

            But, stated otherwise, if the pardon is based on the innocence of the individual, it affirms this innocence and makes him a new man and as innocent; as if he had not been found guilty of the offense charged. When a person is given pardon because he did not truly commit the offense, the pardon relieves the party from all punitive consequences of his criminal act, thereby restoring to him his clean name, good reputation and unstained character prior to the finding of guilt.

It is our considered view that if the President can grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures in criminal cases, with much more reason can she grant executive clemency in administrative cases, which are clearly less serious than criminal offenses.

            The commutation of the penalty is impressed with legal significance. That is an exercise of executive clemency embraced in the pardoning power. According to the Constitution: The President may except in cases of impeachment, grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, remit fines and forfeitures and, with the concurrence of the Batasang Pambansa, grant amnesty.

Parole is normally, provided to a person under the supervision of the Board of Paroles and Pardons. On violation of the imposed conditions the convicted person has to resume the imprisonment upon cancellation of parole. Parole allows a convicted person to complete the sentence in the community.

            Parole can be issued for several reasons because it is less expensive to supervise a parolee than to imprison a convicted person. A person on parole can continue the period of sentence in the society. The society is also granted protection because the parolee is supervised. A parole can be revoked for the most minor of transgressions. Parole is a method of rehabilitation because it gives convicts supervision and guidance during their reentry into society.

            Parole is not a method of reducing sentences or awarding a pardon. Just because a person is eligible for a parole, the convict needs not be provided parole. This is because it is a privilege and not a right. Persons convicted for violent crimes are also provided paroles after hearing. To be eligible for a parole, the person should have served part of the sentence in the jail. Violation of conditions will result in revocation of the parole. If a parole is revoked it will result in re-imprisonment of the offender. (https://pardonandparole. uslegal.com/conditional-pardon/- accessed date: 10/17/2020)

Section 25, Article XVIII further requires that "foreign military bases, troops, or facilities" may be allowed in the Philippines only by virtue of a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate, ratified by a majority of the votes cast in a national referendum held for that purpose if so required H Congress, and recognized as such by the other contracting state.

            It is our considered view that both constitutional provisions, far from contradicting each other, actually share some common ground, These constitutional provisions both embody phrases in the negative and thus, are deemed prohibitory in mandate and character. In particular, Section 21 opens with the clause "No treaty x x x," and Section 25 contains the phrase "shall not be allowed." Additionally, in both instances, the concurrence of the Senate is indispensable render the treaty or international agreement valid and effective.

            To our mind, the fact that the President referred the VFA to the Senate under Section 21, Article VII, and that the Senate extended its concurrence under the same provision, is immaterial For in either case, whether under Section 21, Article VII or Section 25, Article XVIII, the fundamental law is crystalline that the concurrence of the Senate is mandatory to comply with the strict constitutional requirements.

            On the whole, the VFA is an agreement which defines the treatment of United States troops and personnel visiting the Philippines. It provides for the guidelines to govern such visits of military personnel, and further defines the rights of the United States and the Philippine government in the matter of criminal jurisdiction, movement of vessel and aircraft, importation and exportation of equipment, materials and supplies.

            An executive agreement is an agreement between the heads of government of two or more nations that have not been ratified by the legislature as treaties are ratified.

That power has been alluded to in our present and past Constitutions, in various statutes, in Supreme Court decisions, and during the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission. They cover a wide array of subjects with varying scopes and purposes, including those that involve the presence of foreign military forces in the country.

            As the sole organ of our foreign relations and the constitutionally assigned chief architect of our foreign policy, the President is vested with the exclusive power to conduct and manage the country's interface with other states and governments. Being the principal representative of the Philippines, the Chief Executive speaks and listens for the nation; initiates, maintains, and develops diplomatic relations with other states and governments; negotiates and enters into international agreements; promotes trade, investments, tourism, and other economic relations; and settles international disputes with other states. This constitutional mandate emanates from the inherent power of the President to enter into agreements with other states, including the prerogative to conclude binding executive agreements that do not require further Senate concurrence. The existence of this presidential power is so well-entrenched that Section 5(2)(a), Article VIII of the Constitution, even provides for a check on its exercise.

            In Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading, executive agreements are defined as "international agreements embodying adjustments of detail carrying out well-established national policies and traditions and those involving arrangements of a more or less temporary nature." In Bayan Muna v. Romulo, this Court further clarified that executive agreements can cover a wide array of subjects that have various scopes and purposes. The right of the Executive to enter into binding agreements without the necessity of subsequent Congressional approval has been confirmed by long usage. From the earliest days of our history, we have entered into executive agreements covering such subjects as commercial and consular relations, most-favored-nation rights, patent rights, trademark and copyright protection, postal and navigation arrangements and the settlement of claims.

In the early years of the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to impound funds, and many other presidents have followed suit. This power may be exercised by the president subject to certain limitations. During the term of Richard Nixon the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Train vs. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 95 S.

The President has no discretion on the matter, for the Constitution imposes on him the duty to faithfully execute the laws.

            In refusing or deferring the implementation of an appropriation item, the President in effect exercises a veto power that is not expressly granted by the Constitution. As a matter of fact, the Constitution does not say anything about impounding. The source of the Executive authority must be found elsewhere. Proponents of impoundment have invoked at least three principal sources of the authority of the President. Foremost is the authority to impound given to him either expressly or impliedly by Congress. Second is the executive power drawn from the President's role as Commander-in- Chief. Third is the Faithful Execution Clause which ironically is the same provision invoked by petitioners herein.

            The proponents insist that a faithful execution of the laws requires that the President desist from implementing the law if doing so would prejudice public interest. An example given is when through efficient and prudent management of a project, substantial savings are made. In such a case, it is sheer folly to expect the President to spend the entire amount budgeted in the law. (Roco u. Executive Secretary, G.R. No. 113174, August 19, 1994)

However, this does not prevent an examination of whether such power was exercised within permissible constitutional limits or whether it was exercised in a manner constituting grave abuse of discretion. In view of the constitutional intent to give the President full discretionary power to determine the necessity of calling out the armed forces, it is incumbent upon the petitioner to show that the President's decision is totally bereft of factual basis.

            Contrary to petitioners' view, it cannot be denied that the President, upon whom executive power is vested, has unstated residual powers which are implied from the grant of executive power and which are necessary for her to comply with her duties under the Constitution. The powers of the President are not limited to what are expressly enumerated in the article on the Executive Department and in scattered provisions of the Constitution This is so, notwithstanding the avowed intent of the members of the Constitutional Commission of 1986 to limit the powers of the President as a reaction to the abuses under the regime of Mr. Marcos. for the result was a limitation of specific power of the President, particularly those relating to the commander-in-chief clause, but not a diminution of the general grant of executive power.

Despite petitioners' strained the President's implied or residual powers is tantamount to setting analogy, the residual powers of the President under the Constitution should not be confused with the power of the President under the 1973 Constitution to legislate pursuant to Amendment No. 6.

            Congress does not have the power to pass laws that override the Constitution, such as by expanding the scope of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court uses its own understanding of the Constitution in reviewing the legitimacy of acts by other branches of the government, even though this power is not apparent from the plain text of the document.

            It bears to mention that to pray in one petition for the issuance of both a writ of mandamus and a writ of certiorari for the very same act-the non-convening by the two Houses of the Congress in joint session - is contradictory, as the former involves a mandatory duty which the government branch or instrumentality must perform without discretion, while the latter recognizes discretion on the part of the government branch or instrumentality but which was exercised arbitrarily or despotically. Nevertheless, if the Court is to adjudge the petition for certiorari alone, it still finds the same to be without merit. To reiterate, the two Houses of the Congress decided to no longer hold a joint session only after deliberations among their Members and putting the same to vote, in accordance with their respective rules of procedure.

            There is indeed a plethora of cases in which this Court exercised the power of judicial review over congressional action. Thus, in Santiago v. Guingona, Jr., this Court ruled that it is well within the power and jurisdiction of the Court to inquire whether the Senate or its officials committed a violation of the Constitution or grave abuse of discretion in the exercise of their functions and prerogatives. In Tañada v. Angara, in seeking to nullify an act of the Philippine Senate on the ground that it contravened the Constitution, it held that the petition raises a justiciable controversy and that when an action of the legislative branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to settle the dispute. In Bondoc v. Pineda, this Court declared null and void a resolution of the House of Representatives withdrawing the nomination, and rescinding the election, of a congressman as a member of the House Electoral Tribunal for being violative of Section 17, Article VI of the Constitution. In Coseteng v. Mitra, it held that the resolution of whether the House representation in the Commission on Appointments was based on proportional representation of the political parties as provided in Section 18. Article VI of the Constitution is subject to judicial review. In Daza v. Singson, it held that the act of the House of Representatives in removing the petitioner from the Commission on Appointments is subject to judicial review. In Tañada v. Cuenco, it held that although under the Constitution, the legislative power is of the courts to pass upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress. vested exclusively in Congress, this does not detract from the power In Angara v.

It is concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom, not the legality, of a particular measure.' (Defensor-Santiago u. Guingona, G.R. No. 134577, November 18, 1998)

            What is generally meant, when it is said that a question is political, and not judicial, is that it is a matter which is to be exercised by the people in their primary political capacity, or that it has been specifically delegated to some other department or particular officer of the government, with discretionary power to act. It is not for this court to rehearse and re-enact political debates on what the text of the law should be. In political forums, particularly the legislature, the creation of the text of the law is based on a general discussion of factual circumstances, broadly construed in order to allow for general application by the executive branch. Thus, the creation of the law is not limited by particular and specific facts that affect the rights of certain individuals, per se.

            Courts, on the other hand, rule on adversarial positions based on existing facts established on a specific case-to-case basis, where parties affected by the legal provision seek the courts' understanding of the law. The complementary nature of the political and judicial branches of government is essential in order to ensure that the rights of the general public are upheld at all times. In order to preserve this balance, branches of government must afford due respect and deference to the duties and functions constitutionally delegated to the other. Courts cannot rush to invalidate a law or rule. Prudence dictates that we are careful not to veto political acts unless we can craft doctrine narrowly tailored to the circumstances of the case.

            A political question arises in constitutional issues relating to the powers or competence of different agencies and departments of the executive or those of the legislature. The political question doctrine is used as a defense when the petition asks this court to nullify certain acts that are exclusively within the domain of their respective competencies, as provided by the Constitution or the law. In such situation, presumptively, this court should act with deference. It will decline to void an act unless the exercise of that power was so capricious and arbitrary so as to amount to grave abuse of discretion. The concept of a political question, however, never precludes judicial review when the act of a constitutional organ infringes upon a fundamental individual or collective right. (The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 205728, January 21, 2015)

            Political questions refer "to those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of government." Thus, if an issue is clearly identified by the text of the Constitution as matters for discretionary action by a particular branch of government or to the people themselves then it is held to be a political question.

            The Courts' power of judicial review, like almost all other powers conferred by the Constitution, is subject to several limitations, namely: 1) there must be an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power; 2) the person challenging the act must have "standing" to challenge; he must have a personal and substantial interest in the case, such that he has sustained or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement; 3) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity; and 4) the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota of the case. Generally, a party will be allowed to litigate only when these conditions sine qua non are present, especially when the constitutionality of an act by a co-equal branch of government is put in issue. (Chavez v. Judicial and Bar Council, G.R. No. 202242, July 17, 2012)

            Petitioners must, thus, comply with the requisites for the exercise of the power of judicial review: (1) there must be an actual case or justiciable controversy before this Court; (2) the question before this Court must be ripe for adjudication; (3) the person challenging the act must be a proper party; and (4) the issue of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity and must be the very lis mota of the case.

            An actual case or controversy is one that involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice. Stated otherwise, it is not the mere existence of a conflict or controversy that will authorize the exercise by the courts of its power of review; more importantly, the issue involved must be susceptible of judicial determination. Excluded from these are questions of policy or wisdom, otherwise referred to as political questions. (Garcia v. Executive Secretary, G.R. No. 157584, April 2, 2009)

            Corollary to the requirement of an actual case or controversy is the requirement of ripeness. A question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it. For a case to be considered ripe for accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may adjudication, it is a prerequisite that something has then been come into the picture, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself as a result of the challenged action.

            Mootness arises when there is no longer an actual controversy between the parties to a court case, and any ruling by the court would have no actual, practical impact. When the case has become moot, then the court must dismiss the case.

            A moot and academic case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value. Generally, courts decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on ground of mootness. (David v. Macapagal-Arroyo, G.R. No. 171396, May 3, 2006)

            A case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use. In such instance, there is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. Courts generally decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness. This is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it cannot be enforced. (Peñafrancia Sugar Mill, Inc. v.

            When the court talks about ripeness and mootness it is referring to whether it is too early or the case is not yet ripe or too late meaning the case is moot for the court to decide the case.

            As ruled by the Supreme Court in various cases like that of Kilusang Mayo Uno v. Aquino, III, G.R. No. 210500, April 2, 2019, both these concepts relate to the timing of the presentation of a controversy before the Court-ripeness relates to its prematurity, while mootness relates to a belated or unnecessary judgment on the issues. The Court cannot preempt the actions of the parties, and neither should it (as a rule) render judgment after the issue has already been resolved by or through external developments.

            The importance of timing in the exercise of judicial review highlights and reinforces the need for an actual case or controversy - an act that may violate a party's right. Without any completed action or a concrete threat of injury to the petitioning party, the act is not yet ripe for adjudication. It is merely a hypothetical problem. The challenged act must have been accomplished or performed by come into the picture, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to itself as a result of the challenged action. As for mootness, as earlier mentioned, moot cases Courts cannot render judgment after the issue has already been prevent the actual case or controversy from becoming justiciable. resolved by or through external developments.

            This is also known as locus standi. As a general rule, the Court will not act on a controversy brought before its attention unless it is raised by the proper party or the one who has legal standing.

            The Court ruled that "legal standing" or locus standi is defined as a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged. The term "interest" means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges "such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions." (Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora, G.R. No. 141284, August 15, 2000)

            Anent locus standi, the question to be answered is this: does the party possess a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that there is real, concrete, and legal conflict of rights and duties from the issues presented before the Court? In David v. Macapagal-Arroyo, the Court summarized the rules on locus standi as culled from jurisprudence. There, it was held that taxpayers, voters, concerned citizens, and legislators may be accorded standing to sue, provided that the following requirements are met: (1) cases involve constitutional issues; (2) for taxpayers, there must be a claim of illegal disbursement of public funds or that the tax measure is unconstitutional; (3) for voters, there must be a showing of obvious interest in the validity of the election law in question; (4) for concerned citizens, there must be a showing that the issues raised are of transcendental importance which must be settled early; and (5) for legislators, there must be a claim that the official action complained of infringes upon their prerogatives as legislators.

            An organization although not directly affected by a wrongful act may also bring a suit in representation of an affected member. Thus, even in the absence of direct organizational standing, an organization may be able to establish representational standing based on injuries to its members. Having a membership is, of course, essential to establishing representational standing, and it is therefore particularly useful for organizations such as unions, which frequently have an interest in seeking redress on behalf of their members.

            An organization can establish representative standing by showing that at least one of its members has standing, that the interests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose, and that neither the claim nor the relief requires participation of the organization's individual members. (Hunt us. Wash. State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 [1977]) Thinking creatively about bringing cases on behalf of organizations expands the universe of potential plaintiffs. Lawyers who work with organizations should familiarize themselves with these standing doctrines - as well as any landscape shift that occurs when the Supreme Court decides - and use them to bring cases on City of Miami later this spring behalf of organizations that are impacted by unlawful conduct. (Shapiro, Sam, Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP in New York, New York)

            The modern view is that an association has standing to complain of injuries to its members. This view fuses the legal identity of an association with that of its members. An association has standing to file suit for its workers despite its lack of direct interest if its members are affected by the action.

In a typical class action, a plaintiff sues a defendant or a number of defendants on behalf of group, or class, of absent parties. (Wex Legal Dictionary, 2007-08-06)

            Section 12, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court defines a class suit, as follows: When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons so numerous that it is impracticable to join all as parties, a number of them which the court finds to be sufficiently numerous and representative as to fully protect the interests of all concerned may sue or defend for the benefit of all. Any party in interest shall have the right to intervene to protect his individual interest.

            The necessary elements for the maintenance of a class suit are 1) the subject matter of controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons; 2) the parties affected are so numerous that it is impracticable to bring them all to court; and 3) the parties bringing the class suit are sufficiently numerous or representative of the class and can fully protect the interests of all concerned.

            A stockholder may suffer from a wrong done to or involving a corporation, but this does not vest in the aggrieved stockholder a sweeping license to sue in his or her own capacity. The determination of the stockholder's appropriate remedy - whether hinges on it is an individual suit, a class suit, or a derivative suit-1 the object of the wrong done. When the object of the wrong done is the corporation itself or "the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders," it is a derivative suit, not an individual suit or class/representative suit, that a stockholder must resort to.

            A shareholder's derivative suit seeks to recover for the benefit of the corporation and its whole body of shareholders when injury is caused to the corporation that may not otherwise be redressed because of failure of the corporation to act. Thus, 'the action is derivative, i.e., in the corporate right, if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation, or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders, or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.' In contrast, "a direct action [is one] filed by the shareholder individually (or on behalf of a class of shareholders to which he or she belongs) for injury to his or her interest as a shareholder...

            Sometimes, even if the parties bringing the issues to the court have no locus standi, the Court allows the petition to proceed to its ultimate conclusion due to its transcendental importance. As ruled in the case of Zabal v. Duterte, the rule on locus standi is a mere procedural technicality, which the Court, in a long line of cases involving subjects of transcendental importance, has waived or relaxed the issue of locus standi, thus allowing nontraditional plaintiffs such as concerned citizens, taxpayers, voters, and legislators to sue in cases of public interest, albeit they may not have been personally injured by a government act.

            More importantly, the matters raised in this case, involved on one hand, possible violations of the Constitution and, on the other, the need to rehabilitate the country's prime tourist destination.

Based on the standards above-stated, the IBP has failed to present a specific and substantial interest in the resolution of the case.

            It should also be noted that the interest of the National President of the IBP who signed the petition, is his alone, absent a formal board resolution authorizing him to file the present action. To be sure, members of the BAR, those in the judiciary included, have varying opinions on the issue. Moreover, the IBP, assuming that it has duly authorized the National President to file the petition, has not shown any specific injury which it has suffered or may suffer by virtue of the questioned governmental act. Indeed, none of its members, whom the IBP purportedly represents, has sustained any form of injury as a result of the operation of the joint visibility patrols. Neither is it alleged that any of its members has been arrested or that their civil liberties have been violated by the deployment of the Marines. What the IBP projects as injurious is the supposed "militarization" of law enforcement which might threaten Philippine democratic institutions and may cause more harm than good in the long run. Not only is the presumed "injury" not personal in character, it is likewise too vague, highly speculative and uncertain to satisfy the requirement of standing. Since petitioner has not successfully established a direct and personal injury as a consequence of the questioned act, it does not possess the personality to assail the validity of the deployment of the Marines. This Court, however, does not categorically rule that the IBP has absolutely no standing to raise constitutional issues now or in the future. The IBP must, by way of allegations and proof, satisfy this Court that it has sufficient stake to obtain judicial resolution of the controversy.

            Having stated the foregoing, it must be emphasized that this Court has the discretion to take cognizance of a suit which does not satisfy the requirement of legal standing when paramount interest is involved. In not a few cases, the Court has adopted a liberal attitude on the locus standi of a petitioner where the petitioner is able to craft an issue of transcendental significance to the people. Thus, when the issue the issues raised are of paramount importance to the this case, a reading of the petition shows that the IBP has advanced constitutional issues which deserve the attention of this Court in view of their seriousness, novelty and weight as precedents. Moreover, because peace and order are under constant threat and lawless violence occurs in increasing tempo, undoubtedly aggravated in the petition almost certainly will not go away.

            The unchallenged rule is that the person who impugns the validity of a statute must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement. It goes without saying that if Act No. 4221 really violates the Constitution, the People of the Philippines, in whose name the present action is brought, has a substantial interest in having it set aside. Of greater import than the damage caused by the illegal expenditure of public funds is the mortal wound inflicted upon the fundamental law by the enforcement of an invalid statute. Hence, the well-settled rule that the state can challenge the validity of its own laws. In Government of the Philippine Islands v. Springer [1927], 50 Phil. 259 (affirmed in Springer vs. Government of the Philippine Islands [1928], 277 U.S., 189; Law. ed., 845), this court declared an act of the legislature unconstitutional in an action instituted in behalf of the Government of the Philippines. In Attorney General vs. Perkings (1889), 73 Mich., 303, 311, 312, 41  N.W., 426, 428, 429, the State of Michigan, through its Attorney General, instituted quo warranto proceedings to test the right of the respondents to renew a mining corporation, alleging that the statute because it impaired the obligation of contracts. The capacity of the under which the respondents base their right was unconstitutional chief law officer of the state to question the constitutionality of the statute was itself questioned.

            The courts cannot but cautiously exercise its power to overturn the solemn declarations of two of the three grand departments of the governments. Then, there is that peculiar political philosophy which bids the judiciary to reflect the wisdom of the people as expressed through an elective Legislature and an elective Chief Executive. It follows, therefore, that the courts will not set aside a law as violative of the Constitution except in a clear case. This is a proposition too plain to require a citation of authorities.

            """<b>Concerned Citizens' Suit</b> 
             A private citizen may have legal standing to sue. Legal standing is grounded on the petitioner's personal interest in the controversy. A citizen who files a petition before the court asserting a public right satisfies the requirement of personal interest simply because the petitioner is a member of the general public upon which the right is vested. A citizen's personal interest in a case challenging an allegedly unconstitutional act lies in his interest and duty to uphold and ensure the proper execution of the law. (Padilla v. Congress of the Philippines, G.R. No. 231671, July 25, 2017)

            In public suits, the plaintiff, representing the general public, asserts a "public right" in assailing an allegedly illegal official action. The plaintiff may be a person who is affected no differently from any other person, and can be suing as a "stranger," or as a "citizen" or "taxpayer." Thus, taxpayers have been allowed to sue where there is a claim that public funds are illegally disbursed or that public money is being deflected to any improper purpose, or that public funds are wasted through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law. Of greater import than the damage caused by the illegal expenditure of public funds is the mortal wound inflicted upon the fundamental law by the enforcement of an invalid statute. (Chavez v. Judicial and Bar Council, G.R. No. 202242, July 17, 2012)

            The difficulty of determining locus standi arises in public suits. Here, the plaintiff who asserts a "public right" in assailing an allegedly illegal official action, does so as a representative of the general public. He may be a person who is affected no differently from any other person. He could be suing as a "stranger," or in the category of a "citizen," or "taxpayer." In either case, he has to adequately show that he is entitled to seek judicial protection. In other words, he has to make out a sufficient interest in the vindication of the public order and the securing of relief as a "citizen" or "taxpayer."

            Case law in most jurisdictions now allows both "citizen" and "taxpayer" standing in public actions. The distinction was first laid in a taxpayer's suit is in a different category from the plaintiff down in Beauchamp vs. Silk, where it was held that the plaintiff in a tax player's suit is in a different category from the plaintiff in a citizen's suit. In the former, the plaintiff is affected by the  expenditure of public funds, while in the latter, he is but the mere instrument of the public concern.  As held by the New York Suprema  Court in People ex rel Case vs. Collins: "In matter of mere public right,  however...the people are the real parties...It is at least the  right,   if not the duty, of every citizen to interfere and see that a grievance be remedied." With respect to taxpayer's suits, Terr v public offence be properly pursued and punished, and that a public an action in courts to restrain the unlawful use of public funds to his Jordan held that "the right of a citizen and a taxpayer to maintain injury cannot be denied."

            By way of summary, the following rules may be culled from the and legislators may be accorded standing to sue, provided that the cases decided by this Court. Taxpayers, voters, concerned citizens, following requirements are met: (1) cases involve constitutional issues; (2) for taxpayers, there must be a claim of illegal disbursement of public funds or that the tax measure is unconstitutional; (3) for voters, there must be a showing of obvious interest in the validity of the election law in question; (4) for concerned citizens, there must be a showing that the issues raised are of transcendental importance which must be settled early; and (5) for legislators, there must be a claim that the official action complained of infringes upon their prerogatives as legislators.

This rule, which is subject to exceptions, is applicable to criminal cases. In so grave a matter, the constitutional issue should be raised and lodged in the case at the earliest opportunity that orderly procedure will admit under the circumstances. (Robb v. People, G.R.

(12 C.J.,p. 786.  See also, Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Co. vs. Del Rosario, 26 Phil. 192, 193-195) But we must state that the general rule admits  of exceptions. Courts, in the exercise of sound discretion, may determine the time when a question affecting the constitutionality of a statute should be presented. (In re Woolsey (19884), 95 N.Y., 135, 144) Thus, in criminal cases, although there is a very sharp conflict of authorities, it is said that the question may be raised for  the first time at any state of the proceedings, either in the trial court or on appeal. (People v. Vera, G.R. No. L-45685, November 16, 1937) 

            Unequivocally, the law requires that the question of constitutionality of a statute must be raised at the earliest opportunity. In Matibag u. Benipayo, we held that the earliest opportunity to raise a constitutional issue is to raise it in the pleadings before a competent court that can resolve the same, such that, if it was not raised in the pleadings before a competent court, it cannot be considered at the trial, and, if not considered in the trial, it cannot be considered on appeal. (Estarija v. Rañada, G.R. No. 159314, June 26, 2006)

            The question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity. The settled rule is that courts will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it. This Court held that such opportunity is in the pleadings before a competent court that can resolve it, such that "if it is not raised in the pleadings, it cannot be considered at the trial, and, if not considered at the trial, it cannot be considered on appeal." The decision upon the constitutional question is necessary to determine whether the TPO should be issued against petitioner. Such question should have been raised at the earliest opportunity as an affirmative defense in the Opposition filed with the RTC handling the protection order proceedings, which was the competent court to pass upon the constitutional issue.

            <em>Lis mota</em> is a Latin phrase which literally means litigation moved. This is the cause or motivation of a legal action or lawsuit. the fourth requirement The Supreme Court ruled that lis mota - to satisfy before this Court will undertake judicial review means that the Court will not pass upon a question of unconstitutionality, although properly presented if the case can be disposed of on some other grounds, such as the application of the statute or the general law. The petitioner must be able to show that the case cannot be legally resolved unless the constitutional question raised is determined.  This requirement is based on the rule that every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality; to justify its nullification, there resolved  must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, and not one that is doubtful, speculative, or argumentative.

            <em>Lis mota</em> literally means "the cause of the suit or action" This last requisite of judicial review is simply an offshoot of the presumption of validity accorded the executive and legislative acts of our co-equal branches of the government. Ultimately, it is rooted in the principle of separation of powers. Given the presumed validity of an executive act, the petitioner who claims otherwise has the burden of showing first that the case cannot be resolved unless the constitutional question he raised is determined by the Court (General v. Urro, G.R. No. 191560, March 29, 2011)

            The lis <em>mota</em> requirement means that the petitioner who questions the constitutionality of a law must show that the case cannot be resolved unless the disposition of the constitutional question is unavoidable. Consequently, if there are some other grounds (i.e., a statute or law) upon which the court may rest its judgment, that course should be adopted and the question of constitutionality avoided.

            Judicial review has three functions. First, it allows justice to be served by striking down erroneous decisions by lower courts. Second, appellate courts monitor the performance of lower courts; lower courts have an incentive to apply the law correctly if the possibility exists that their decisions may be overturned. Third, important controversies regarding the law are examined and resolved for the future guidance of courts and individuals. This third function is the primary concern of the highest courts, which in most cases agree to hear appeals only at their discretion.

            To justify the nullification of the law or its implementation, there must be a clear and unequivocal, not a doubtful, breach of the Constitution.  In case of doubt in the sufficiency of proof establishing unconstitutionality, the Court must sustain legislation because "to invalidate  a law on baseless supposition is an affront to the wisdom not only of the legislature that passed it but also of the executive which approved it." This presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the clearest showing that there was indeed an  infraction of the Constitution, and only when such a conclusion is reached by the required majority may the Court pronounce, in the discharge of the duty it cannot escape, that the challenged act must be struck down.

            """<b>Doctrine of Purposeful Hesitation</b>
            In the exercise of jurisdiction, lower courts are advised to act with the utmost circumspection, bearing in mind the consequences of a declaration of unconstitutionality upon the stability of laws, no less than on the doctrine of separation of powers. As the questioned act is usually the handiwork of the legislative or the executive departments, or both, it will be prudent for such courts, if only out of a becoming modesty, to defer to the higher judgment of this Court in the consideration of its validity, which is better determined after a thorough deliberation by a collegiate body and with the concurrence of the majority of those who participated in its discussion.

            It is also emphasized that every court, including this Court, is charged with the duty of a purposeful hesitation before declaring a law unconstitutional, on the theory that the measure was first carefully studied by the executive and the legislative departments and determined by them to be in accordance with the fundamental law before it was finally approved. To doubt is to sustain. The showing that there was indeed an infraction of the Constitution, and presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the clearest only when such a conclusion is reached by the required majority may the Court pronounce, in the discharge of the duty it cannot escape, that the challenged act must be struck down.

            """<b>Effects of Declaration of Unconstitutionality</b> 
            This court is not unmindful of the fundamental criteria in favor of the constitutionality of a statute. An act of the legislature cases of this nature that all reasonable doubts should be resolved in limitations. The responsibility of upholding the Constitution rests approved by the executive, is presumed to be within constitutional of the validity of every statute is first determined by the legislative not on the courts alone but on the legislature as well. "The question department of the government itself." (People v. Vera, G.R. No. L-45685, November 16, 1937)

            There are two views on the effects of a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a statute.

            The first is the orthodox view. Under this rule, as announced in Norton vs. Shelby, an unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers right; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, inoperative, as if it had not been passed. It is therefore stricken from the statute books and considered never to have existed at all. Not only the parties but all persons are bound by the declaration of unconstitutionality, which means that no one may thereafter invoke it nor may the courts be permitted to apply it in subsequent cases. It is, in other words, a total nullity.

            The second or modern view is less stringent. Under this view, the court in passing upon the question of constitutionality does not annul or repeal the statute if it finds it in conflict with the Constitution. It simply refuses to recognize it and determines the rights of the parties just as if such statute had no existence. The court may give its reasons for ignoring or disregarding the law, but the decision affects the parties only and there is no judgment against the statute. The opinion or reasons of the court may operate as a precedent for the determination of other similar cases, but it does not strike the statute from the statute books; it does not repeal, supersede, revoke, or annul the statute. The parties to the suit are concluded by the judgment, but no one else is bound. The orthodox view is expressed in Article 7 of the Civil Code, providing that "when the courts declare a law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the former shall be void and the latter shall govern." (Republic v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 79732, November 8, 1993)

            The strict view considers a legislative enactment which is declared unconstitutional as being, for all legal intents and purposes, a total nullity, and it is deemed as if had never existed. 

            Here, of course, we refer to the law itself being per se repugnant to the Constitution. It is not always the case, however, that a law is constitutionally faulty per se. Thus, it may well be valid in its general import, but invalid in its application to certain factual situations. To exemplify, an otherwise valid law may be held unconstitutional only in so far as it is allowed to operate retrospectively such that, in pertinent cases, when it vitiates contractually vested rights. To that extent, its retroactive application may be so declared invalid as impairing the obligations of contracts.

            A judicial declaration of invalidity, it is also true, may not necessarily obliterate all the effects and consequences of a void act occurring prior to such a declaration. Thus, in our decisions on the moratorium laws, we have been constrained to recognize the interim effects of said laws prior to their declaration of unconstitutionality, but there we have likewise been unable to simply ignore strong considerations of equity and fair play. So also, even as a practical matter, a situation that may aptly be described as fait accompli may no longer be open for further inquiry, let alone to be unsettled by a subsequent declaration of nullity of a governing statute.

            """<b>Doctrine of Operative Fact</b>
            To explain, the operative fact doctrine exhorts the recognition that until the judiciary, in an appropriate case, declares the invalidity of a certain legislative or executive act, such act is presumed constitutional and thus, entitled to obedience and respect and should be properly enforced and complied with. As explained in the recent case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation, the doctrine merely "reflects awareness that precisely because the judiciary is the governmental organ which has the final say on whether or not a legislative or executive measure is valid, a period of time may have elapsed before it can exercise the power of judicial review that may lead to a declaration of nullity. It would be to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and justice then, if there be no recognition of what had transpired prior to such adjudication." "In the language of an American Supreme Court decision: The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination of unconstitutionality, is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.'"

            """<b>Doctrine of Operative Fact is a Rule of Equity</b>
            Under the operative fact doctrine, the law is recognized as unconstitutional but the effects of the unconstitutional law, prior to its declaration of nullity, may be left undisturbed as a matter of equity and fair play. In fact, the invocation of the operative fact doctrine is an admission that the law is unconstitutional.

            The operative fact doctrine is a rule of equity. As such, it must be as an exception to the general rule that an unconstitutional applied no effects. It can never be invoked to validate as law produces constitutional an unconstitutional act. The general rule is that an unconstitutional law is void. It produces no rights, imposes no duties and affords no protection. It has no legal effect. It is, in legal contemplation, inoperative as if it has not been passed. When the courts declare a law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the former shall be void and the latter shall govern.

            The doctrine of operative fact, as an exception to the general rule, only applies as a matter of equity and fair play. It nullifies the effects of an unconstitutional law by recognizing that the existence of a statute prior to a determination of unconstitutionality is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot always be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.

            The doctrine is applicable when a declaration of unconstitutionality will impose an undue burden on those who have relied on the invalid law. Thus, it was applied to a criminal case when a declaration of unconstitutionality would put the accused in double jeopardy or would put in limbo the acts done by a municipality in reliance upon a law creating it.

            The operative fact doctrine never validates or constitutionalizes an unconstitutional law. Under the operative fact doctrine, the unconstitutional law remains unconstitutional, but the effects of the unconstitutional law, prior to its judicial declaration of nullity, may be left undisturbed as a matter of equity and fair play. In short, the operative fact doctrine affects or modifies only the effects of the unconstitutional law, not the unconstitutional law itself. (League of Cities v. Comelec, G.R.

            The Constitution provides in Article VI, Section 30 that, "No law shall be passed increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution without its advice and concurrence." This provision is intended to give the Supreme Court a measure of control over cases placed under its appellate jurisdiction. For the indiscriminate enactment of legislation enlarging its appellate jurisdiction can unnecessarily burden the Court and thereby undermine its essential function of expounding the law in its most profound national aspects.

            A judgment rendered without jurisdiction is a void judgment. This want of jurisdiction may pertain to lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or over the person of one of the parties.

            A careful reading of the above constitutional provision, however, reveals the intention of the framers to draw a distinction between cases, on the one hand, and matters, on the other hand, such that cases are "decided" while matters, which include motions, are "resolved." Otherwise put, the word "decided" must refer to "cases"; while the word "resolved" must refer to "matters," applying the rule of reddendo singula singulis. This is true not only in the interpretation of the above-quoted Article VIII, Section 4(3), but also of the other provisions of the Constitution where these words appear.

            With the aforesaid rule of construction in mind, it is clear that only cases are referred to the Court en banc for decision whenever the required number of votes is not obtained. Conversely, the rule does not apply where, as in this case, the required three votes is not obtained in the resolution of a motion for reconsideration. Hence, the second sentence of the afore quoted provision speaks only of "case" and not "matter." The reason is simple. The above-quoted Article VIII, Section 4(3) pertains to the disposition of cases by a division. If there is a tie in the voting, there is no decision. The only way to dispose of the case then is to refer it to the Court en bane. On the other hand, if a case has already been decided by the division and the losing party files a motion for reconsideration, the failure of the division to resolve the motion because of a tie in the voting does not leave the case undecided. There is still the decision which must stand in view of the failure of the members of the division to muster the necessary vote for its reconsideration. Quite plainly, if the voting results in a tie, the motion for reconsideration is lost. (Fortich v Corona, G.R. No. 131457, August 19, 1999)

            """<b>Review of Death Penalty</b>
            The same constitutional article has evidently been a thesis for Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section in Section 3 of Rule 122, Section 10 of Rule 122, Section 13 of Rule 22 of Republic Act No. 7659, as well as procedural rules contained 124, and Section 3 of Rule 125 of the Rules of Court. It must be stressed, however, that the constitutional provision is not preclusive in character, and it does not necessarily prevent the Court, in the exercise of its rule-making power, from adding an intermediate appeal or review in favor of the accused.

            In passing, during the deliberations among the members of the Court, there has been a marked absence of unanimity on the crucial point of guilt or innocence of herein appellant. Some are convinced that the evidence would appear to be sufficient to convict; some would accept the recommendation of acquittal from the Solicitor General on the ground of inadequate proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, the occasion best demonstrates the typical dilemma, i.e., the determination and appreciation of primarily factual matters, which the Supreme Court has had to face within automatic review cases; yet, it is the Court of Appeals that has aptly been given the direct mandate to review factual issues.

            While the Fundamental Law requires a mandatory review by the Supreme Court of cases where the penalty imposed is reclusion perpetua, life imprisonment, or death, nowhere, however, has it proscribed an intermediate review. If only to ensure utmost circumspection before the penalty of death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment is imposed, the Court now deems it wise and compelling to provide in these cases a review by the Court of Appeals before the case is elevated to the Supreme Court. Where life and liberty are at stake, all possible avenues to determine his guilt or innocence must be accorded an accused, and no care in the evaluation of the facts can ever be overdone. A prior determination by the Court of Appeals on, particularly, the factual issues, would minimize the affirm the penalty of death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, possibility of an error of judgment. If the Court of Appeals should it could then render judgment imposing the corresponding penalty as the circumstances so warrant, refrain from entering judgment and elevate the entire records of the case to the Supreme Court for its final disposition.

            Pertinent provisions of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, more particularly Section 3 and Section 10 of Rule 122, Section 13 of Rule 124, Section 3 of Rule 125, and any other rule in so to the Supreme Court in cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, as well as the resolution of far as they provide for direct appeals from the Regional Trial Courts the Supreme Court en banc, dated 19 September 1995, in "Internal Rules of the Supreme Court" in cases similarly involving the death penalty, are to be deemed modified accordingly.

            """<b>Independence of the Judiciary</b> 
            Judicial independence is the ability of courts and judges to perform their duties free of influence or control by other actors, whether governmental or private. The term is also used in a normative sense to refer to the kind of independence that courts and judges ought to possess. (https://www.britannica.com/topic/ judicial-independence - accessed date: 10/24/2020)

            The independence of the judiciary is an important factor in fair trial and the proper administration of justice. To guarantee judicial independence, the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the following principles based on the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held in Milan, Italy from August 26 to September 6, 1985:

            1. The independence of the judiciary shall be guaranteed by the State and enshrined in the Constitution or the law of the country. It is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary.

            2. The judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats, or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.

            3. The judiciary shall have jurisdiction over all issues of a judicial nature and shall have exclusive authority to decide whether an issue submitted for its decision is within its competence as defined by law.

            4. There shall not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process, nor shall judicial decisions by the courts be subject to revision. This principle is without prejudice authorities of sentences imposed by the judiciary, in accordance to judicial review or to mitigation or commutation by competent with the law.

            5. Everyone shall have the right to be tried by ordinary courts or tribunals using established legal procedures. Tribunals that do not use the duly established procedures of the legal process shall not be created to displace the jurisdiction belonging to the ordinary courts or judicial tribunals.

            6. The principle of the independence of the judiciary entitles and requires the judiciary to ensure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected.

            7. It is the duty of each Member State to provide adequate resources to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions.

            Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of De La Llana U. Alba that, "The Constitution does not speak in the language of ambiguity: "A public office is a public trust." That is more than a moral adjuration. It is a legal imperative. The law may vest in a public official certain rights. It does so to enable them to perform his functions and fulfill his responsibilities more efficiently. It is from that standpoint that the security of tenure provision to assure judicial independence is to be viewed. It is an added guarantee that justices and judges can administer justice undeterred by any fear of reprisal or untoward consequence. Their judgments then are even more likely to be inspired solely by their knowledge of the law and the dictates of their conscience, free from the corrupting influence of base or unworthy motives. The independence of which they are assured is impressed with a significance transcending that of a purely personal right. As thus viewed, it is not solely for their welfare. The challenged legislation is subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny by this Tribunal, lest by lack of due care and circumspection, it allow the erosion of that Ideal so firmly embedded in the national consciousness. There is this further thought to in one's mind and heart. As emphasized by former Chief Justice consider. Independence in thought and action necessarily is rooted Paras in Ocampo v. Secretary of Justice, there is no surer guarantee of judicial independence than the God-given character and fitness of those appointed to the Bench. The judges may be guaranteed a fixed tenure of office during good behavior, but if they are of such stuff as allows them to be subservient to one administration after another, or to cater to the wishes of one litigant after another, the independence of the judiciary will be nothing more than a myth or of Lord Coke, regardless or in spite of the power of Congress - an empty Ideal. Our judges, we are confident, can be of the type inferior courts." That is to recall one of the greatest Common Law do not say unlimited but as herein exercised to reorganize who at the cost of his office made clear that he would not just blindly obey the King's order but "will do what becomes [him] as a judge." So it was pointed out in the first leading case stressing the independence of the judiciary, Borromeo v. Mariano, the ponencia of Justice Malcolm identified good judges with "men who have accordance with law, who are permitted to perform the duties of the a mastery of the principles of law, who discharge their duties in office undeterred by outside influence, and who are independent and self-respecting human units in a judicial system equal and coordinate to the other two departments of government." There is no reason to assume that the failure of this suit to annul Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 would be attended with deleterious consequences to the administration of justice. It does not follow that the abolition in good faith of the existing inferior courts except the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals and the creation of new ones will result in a judiciary unable or unwilling to discharge with independence its solemn duty or one recreant to the trust reposed in it. Nor should there be any fear that less than good faith will attend the exercise be of the appointing power vested in the Executive. It cannot be denied that an independent and efficient judiciary is something to the credit of any administration. Well and truly has it been said that the fundamental principle of separation of powers assumes, and justifiably so, that the three departments are as one in their determination to pursue the Ideals and aspirations and to fulfilling the hopes of the sovereign people as expressed in the Constitution.

            """<b>Constitutional Safeguards to Insure Judicial Independence</b>
            In order to secure the independence of the judiciary, the Constitution has instituted measures to shield it from the interference of the other branches of the government:

            1. The Supreme Court is a constitutional body, it may not be abolished by law;

            2. Its members are only removable by impeachment (but in the case of Republic v. Sereno, G.R. No. 237428, May 11, 2018, they  may also be removed by quo warranto proceedings);

            3. The Supreme Court may not be deprived of minimum and appellate jurisdiction; appellate jurisdiction may not be increased without its advice or concurrence (Section 30, Article VI);

            4. The Supreme Court has administrative supervision over all inferior courts and personnel (Section 6, Article VIII);

            5. The Supreme Court has exclusive power to discipline judges/justices of inferior courts (Section 11, Article VIII);

            6. The members of the judiciary enjoy security of tenure (Sections 2, 11, Article VIII);

            7. The members of judiciary may not be designated to any agency performing quasi-judicial or administrative functions (Section 12, Article VII);

            8. The salaries of judges may not be reduced and the judiciary enjoys fiscal autonomy (Section 10, Article VIII);

            9. The Supreme Court alone may initiate Rules of Court (Section 5[5], Article VIII);

            10. The Supreme Court alone may order temporary detail of judges (Section 5[3], Article VIII);

            11. The Supreme Court alone can appoint all officials and employees of the judiciary (Section 5[6], Article VIII).

            """<b>Fiscal Autonomy</b>
            The Judiciary shall enjoy fiscal autonomy. Appropriations for the Judiciary may not be reduced by the legislature below the amount appropriated for the previous year and, after approval, shall be automatically and regularly released. (Section 3, Article VIII)

            <b>Fiscal autonomy</b> means freedom from outside control. If the Supreme Court says it needs 100 typewriters but DBM rules we need only 10 typewriters and sends its recommendations to Congress without even informing us, the autonomy given by the Constitution becomes an empty and illusory platitude.

            One of the most important aspects of judicial independence is the constitutional grant of fiscal autonomy. Just as the Executive may not prevent a judge from discharging his or her judicial duty hearings) and just as the Legislature may not enact laws removing (for example, by physically preventing a court from holding its all jurisdiction from courts, the courts may not be obstructed from their freedom to use or dispose of their funds for purposes germane legislatures to control the purse in the first instance is unquestioned, to judicial functions. While, as a general proposition, the authority of Judiciary's fiscal autonomy amounts to an improper check on a co- any form of interference by the Legislative or the Executive on the equal branch of government. If the judicial branch is to perform its primary function of adjudication, it must be able to command adequate resources for that purpose. This authority to exercise purse (which at first blush appears to be a violation of concepts of (or to compel the exercise of) legislative power over the national separateness and an invasion of legislative autonomy) is necessary to maintain judicial independence and is expressly provided for by the Constitution through the grant of fiscal autonomy under Section 3. Article VIII.

            The Constitution expressly prohibits Congress from depriving the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction, as enumerated in Section 5. Article VII of the Constitution, or from passing a law that undermines the security of tenure of the members of the judiciary. The Constitution also mandates that the judiciary shall enjoy fiscal autonomy, and grants the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all courts and judicial personnel. Jurisprudence has characterized administrative supervision as exclusive, noting that only the Supreme Court can oversee the judges and court personnel's compliance with all laws, rules and regulations. No other branch of government may intrude into this power, without running afoul of the doctrine of separation of powers.

            The Constitution protects as well the salaries of the Justices and judges by prohibiting any decrease in their salary during their continuance in office, and ensures their security of tenure by providing that "Members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts shall hold office during good behavior until they reach the age of seventy years or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of their office." With these guarantees, justices and judges can administer justice undeterred by any fear of reprisals brought on by their judicial action. They can act inspired solely by their knowledge of the law and by the dictates of their conscience, free from the corrupting influence of base or unworthy motives.

            All of these constitutional provisions were put in place to strengthen judicial independence, not only by clearly stating the Court's powers but also by providing express limits on the power of two other branches of government to interfere with the Court's  affairs.

            For the lower courts, the President shall issue the appointments within 90 days from the submission of the list. (Section 9, Article VIII)
            """,
            """<b>Appointments to the Judiciary Not Covered by Election Ban</b>
            As can be seen, Article VII is devoted to the Executive Department, and, among others, it lists the powers vested by the Constitution in the President. The presidential power of appointment is dealt with in Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Article.

            Article VIII is dedicated to the Judicial Department and defines the duties and qualifications of Members of the Supreme Court, among others. Section 4(1) and Section 9 of this Article are the provisions specifically providing for the appointment of Supreme Court Justices. In particular, Section 9 states that the appointment of Supreme Court Justices can only be made by the President upon the submission of a list of at least three nominees by the JBC; Section 4(1) of the Article mandates the President to fill the vacancy within 90 days from the occurrence of the vacancy.

            Had the framers intended to extend the prohibition contained in Section 15, Article VII to the appointment of Members of the Supreme Court, they could have explicitly done so. They could not have ignored the meticulous ordering of the provisions. They would have easily and surely written the prohibition made explicit in Section 15, Article VII as being equally applicable to the appointment of Members of the Supreme Court in Article VIII itself, most likely in Section 4 (1), Article VIII. That such specification was not done only reveals that the prohibition against the President or Acting President making appointments within two months before the next presidential elections and up to the end of the President's or Acting President's term does not refer to the Members of the Supreme Court.

Under the old system, all appointments to the bench, were made by the President but subject to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments. As such, the process became so politicized as the Commission on Appointments, in deference to the President, confirms almost every appointment made by the President to the judiciary.
            """,
            """<b>A Representative of Congress in the Judicial and Bar Council</b> 
            From a simple reading of the above-quoted provision, it can readily be discerned that the provision is clear and unambiguous. The first paragraph calls for the creation of a JBC and places the same under the supervision of the Court. Then it goes to its composition where the regular members are enumerated: a representative of the Integrated Bar, a professor of law, a retired member of the Court, and a representative from the private sector. On the second part lies the crux of the present controversy. It enumerates the ex officio or special members of the JBC composed of the Chief Justice, who shall be its Chairman, the Secretary of Justice and "a representative of Congress."

            As petitioner correctly posits, the use of the singular letter "a" room for any other construction. It is indicative of what the members preceding "representative of Congress" is unequivocal and leaves no of the Constitutional Commission had in mind, that is, Congress may designate only one representative to the JBC. Had it been the intention that more than one representative from the legislature would sit in the JBC, the Framers could have, in no  uncertain terms, so provided.

            One of the primary and basic rule in statutory construction is that where the words of a statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied  without attempted interpretation. It is a well-settled principle of constitutional construction that the language employed in the the Constitution should be understood in the sense they have in technical terms are employed. As much as possible, the words of Constitution must be given their ordinary meaning except where common use. What it says according to the text of the provision to be construed compels acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the people mean what they say. Verba legis non est recedendum - from the words of a statute there should be no departure.

            The raison d'être for the rule is essentially two-fold: First, because it is assumed that the words in which constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained: and second, because the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer's document but essentially that of the people, in whose consciousness it should ever be present as an important condition for the rule of law to prevail.

            Moreover, under the maxim noscitur a sociis, where a particular word or phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various meanings, its correct construction may be made clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is founded or with which it is associated. This is because a word or phrase in a statute is always used in association with other words or phrases, and its meaning may, thus, be modified or restricted by the latter. The particular words, clauses, and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole. A statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible. In short, every meaning to be given to each word or phrase must be ascertained from the context of the body of the statute since a word or phrase in a statute is always used in association with other words or phrases and its meaning may be modified or restricted by the latter.

            Applying the foregoing principle to this case, it becomes apparent that the word "Congress" used in Article VIII, Section 8(1) of the Constitution is used in its generic sense. No particular of Representatives is being referred to, but that, in either case, allusion whatsoever is made on whether the Senate or the House only a singular representative may be allowed to sit in the JBC. The foregoing declaration is but sensible, since, as pointed out by an esteemed former member of the Court and consultant of the JBC in his memorandum, "from the enumeration of the membership of the JBC, it is patent that each category of members pertained to a single individual only."

            Indeed, the spirit and reason of the statute may be passed upon where a literal meaning would lead to absurdity, contradiction, or defeat the clear purpose of the lawmakers. Not any of injustice, these instances, however, is present in the case at bench. Considering that the language of the subject constitutional provision is plain and unambiguous, there is no need to resort extrinsic aids such as records of the Constitutional Commission.

            The Judicial and Bar Council is hereby enjoined to reconstitute itself so that only one member of Congress will sit as a representative in its proceedings, in accordance with Section 8(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution.

            """<b>The Judicial and Bar Council Is Not a Quasi-Judicial Body</b>
            It is beyond question that the JBC does not fall within the scope of a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi- judicial functions. Neither did it act in any judicial or quasi-judicial capacity nor did it assume any performance of judicial or quasi- judicial prerogative in adopting the rotational scheme of Congress, which was the reason for not counting the votes of the petitioner in its En Banc deliberations last December 2 and 9, 2016. But, despite this, its act is still not beyond this Court's reach as the same is correctible by certiorari if it is tainted with grave abuse of discretion even if it is not exercising judicial and quasi-judicial functions. Now, did the JBC abuse its discretion in adopting the six- month rotational arrangement and in not counting the votes of the petitioner? This Court answers in the negative. As correctly pointed out by the JBC, in adopting the said arrangement, it merely acted pursuant to the Constitution and the Chavez ruling, which both require only one representative from Congress in the JBC. It cannot, therefore, be faulted for simply complying with the Constitution and jurisprudence. Moreover, said arrangement was crafted by both Houses of Congress and the JBC merely adopted the same. By n stretch of imagination can it be regarded as grave abuse of discretion on the part of the JBC. (Umali v. Judicial and Bar Council, G.R. No. 228628, July 25, 2017)

            """<b>Composition of the Supreme Court</b>
            The Supreme Court shall be composed of a Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices. It may sit en banc or in its discretion, in division of three, five, or seven Members. Any vacancy shall be filled within 90 days from the occurrence thereof. (Section 4, Article VII)

            A review of Sections 4(1) and 9 of Article VIII shows that the Supreme Court is composed of a Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices, who all shall be appointed by the President from a list of at least three nominees prepared by the JBC for every vacancy, which appointments require no confirmation by the Commission on Appointments. With reference to the Chief Justice, he or she is appointed by the President as Chief Justice, and the appointment is never in an acting capacity. The express reference to a Chief Justice abhors the idea that the framers contemplated an Acting Chief Justice to head the membership of the Supreme Court. Otherwise, they would have simply written so in the Constitution. Consequently, to rely on Section 12 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 in order to forestall the imperative need to appoint the next Chief Justice soonest is to defy the plain intent of the Constitution.

            For sure, the framers intended the position of Chief Justice to be permanent, not one to be occupied in an acting or temporary capacity. In relation to the scheme of things under the present Constitution, Section 12 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 only responds to a rare situation in which the new Chief Justice is not yet appointed, or in which the incumbent Chief Justice is unable to perform the duties and powers of the office. It ought to be remembered, however, that it was enacted because the Chief Justice appointed under the 1935 Constitution was subject to the confirmation of the Commission on Appointments, and the confirmation process might take longer than expected.

            """<b>Qualifications of the Members of the Supreme Court</b> 
            No person shall be appointed Member of the Supreme Court or any lower collegiate court unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines. A Member of the Supreme Court must be at least 40 years of age, and must have been for 15 years or more, a judge of a lower court or engaged in the practice of law in the Philippines.

            The Congress shall prescribe the qualifications of judges of lower courts, but no person may be appointed judge thereof unless he is a citizen of the Philippines and a member of the Philippine Bar.

            A member of the Judiciary must be a person of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence. (Section 7, Article VIII)

            The question of whether or not a nominee possesses the requisite qualifications is determined based on facts and as such, generates no exercise of discretion on the part of the nominating body. Thus, whether a nominee is of the requisite age, is a natural-born citizen, has met the years of law practice, and is of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence are to be determined based on facts and cannot be made dependent on inference or discretion, much less concessions, which the recommending authority may make or extend. To say that the determination of whether a nominee is of "proven integrity" is a task absolutely contingent upon the discretion of the JBC is to place the integrity requirement on a plateau different from the rest of the Constitutional requirements, when no such distinction is assigned by the Constitution. As well, to treat as discretionary on the part of the JBC the question of whether a nominee is of "proven integrity" is to render the Court impotent to nullify an otherwise unconstitutional nomination unless the Court's jurisdiction is invoked on the ground of grave abuse of discretion. Such severely limiting course of action would effectively diminish the Court's collegial power of supervision over the JBC. (Republic v. Sereno, G.R. No. 237428, June 19, 2018)
            """,
            """<b>Integrity as a Qualification</b>
            Integrity has, at all times, been stressed to be one of the required qualifications of judge. It is not new concept in the vocation of administering and dispensing justice. In the early 1600's, Francis Bacon, philosopher, statesman, and jurist, in his "Essay LVI: Of Judicature" said "above all things, integrity is the Judge's portion and proper virtue." Neither is integrity complex concept necessitating esoteric philosophical disquisitions to be understood. Simply, it qualification of being honest, truthful, and having steadfast adherence to moral and ethical principles. Integrity connotes being consistent doing the right thing in accordance with the law and ethical standards every time. Hence, every judicial officer in any but with codes and canons of conduct and ethical standards as well, society is required to comply, not only with the laws and legislations without derogation. As Thomas Jefferson remarked, "it is of great importance to set resolution, never not to be shaken, never to tell and he who permits himself to tell lie once, finds it much easier an untruth. There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible to do it second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual, he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world's believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart and in time depraves all its good dispositions." Mental dishonesty and moral mischief breed all that integrity is not.

            In our jurisdiction, one cannot be qualified to be member of the Judiciary, lacking such mandatory requirement of "proven integrity." Inevitably, an appointee to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must be the exemplar of honesty, probity, and integrity. The purpose of this requirement is self-evident as the Chief Justice heads the Judiciary and adjudicates cases as member of the Court that "has the last word on what the law is." Together with other Justices, the Chief Justice also disciplines members of the Bar for misconduct. The significance of probity and integrity as requirement for appointment to the Judiciary is underscored by the fact that such qualifications are not explicitly required of the President, the Vice-President, or the Members of Congress under the Constitution. The Constitution, thus, demands in no uncertain terms that the Chief Justice be the embodiment of moral and ethical principles. He or she must be of unquestionable character, possessed of moral authority to demand obedience to the law and to impose rule of conduct. Indeed, one who exacts compliance with the law and ethical standards should be their foremost adherent.

            It is also important to note that the Court has always viewed integrity with goal of preserving the confidence of the litigants in the Judiciary. In Edaño v. Judge Asdala, the Court stated that, "The New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary mandates that judges must not only maintain their independence, integrity, and impartiality; but they must also avoid any appearance of impropriety or partiality, which may erode the people's faith in the Judiciary. Integrity and impartiality, as well as the appearance thereof, are deemed essential not just in the proper discharge of judicial office, but also to the personal demeanor of judges. This standard applies not only to the decision itself, but also to the process by which the decision is made. Section 1, Canon 2, specifically mandates judges is perceived to be so in the view of reasonable observers. Clearly, to ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it it is of vital importance not only that independence, integrity and decisions, but that these must also appear to have been so observed impartiality have been observed by judges and reflected in their in the eyes of the people, so as to avoid any erosion of faith in the justice system. Thus, judges must be circumspect in their actions in order to avoid doubt and suspicion in the dispensation of justice.

            To make sure that applicants to judicial positions possess these constitutionally-prescribed character requirement, the JBC was created. Jardeleza captures the purpose of the JBC which it finds to be rooted in the categorical constitutional declaration that "a member of the Judiciary must be person of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence." To ensure the fulfillment of these standards in every member of the Judiciary, the JBC has been tasked to screen aspiring judges and justices, among others, making certain that the nominees submitted to the President are all qualified and suitably best for appointment. Jardeleza continues that, in this manner, the appointing process itself is shielded from the possibility of extending judicial appointment to the undeserving and mediocre and, more importantly, to the ineligible or disqualified.

            """<b>Non-filing of SALN Affects Integrity</b>
            Indeed, respondent's case is peculiar in that her omission to file her SALN also formed part of the allegations against her in the Verified Complaint for Impeachment. Verily, the filing of the SALN is Constitutional requirement, and the transgression of which may, in the wisdom of the impeachment court, be interpreted as constituting culpable violation of the Constitution. But then, respondent, unlike the President, the Vice-President, Members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman, apart from having to comply with the Constitutional SALN requirement, also answers to the unique Constitutional qualification of having to be person of proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence- qualifications not expressly required by the fundamental law for the other impeachable officers. And as will be extensively demonstrated hereunder, respondent's failure to file her SALNs and to submit the same to the JBC go into the very qualification of integrity. In other words, when [a] Member of the Supreme Court transgresses the SALN requirement prior to his or her appointment as such, he or she commits violation of the Constitution and belies his or her qualification to hold the office. It is not therefore accurate to place Members of the Supreme Court, such as respondent, on absolutely equal plane as that of the other impeachable officers, when more stringent and burdensome requirements for qualification and holding of office are expressly placed upon them.

            In the same vein, the fact that the violation of the SALN requirement formed part of the impeachment complaint does not justify shifting responsibility to the Congress, no matter how noble the respondent and the intervenors portray such act to be. The fact remains that the Republic raised an issue as to respondent's eligibility to occupy the position of Chief Justice, an obviously legal question, which can be resolved through review of jurisprudence and pertinent laws. Logic, common sense, reason, practicality, and even principles of plain arithmetic bear out the conclusion that an unqualified public official should be removed from the position immediately if indeed Constitutional and legal requirements were not met or breached. To abdicate from resolving legal controversy simply because of perceived availability of another remedy, in this case impeachment would be to sanction the initiation of process specifically intended to be long and arduous and compel the entire membership of the Legislative branch to momentarily abandon their legislative duties to focus on impeachment proceedings for the possible removal of public official, who at the outset, may clearly be unqualified under existing laws and case law. Evidently, this scenario would involve waste of time, not to mention unnecessary disbursement of public funds. (Republic v. Sereno, G.R. No. 237428, May 11, 2018)

            """<b>Supervision over the Judiciary</b> 
            The Supreme Court shall have administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof. (Section 6, Article VIII)

            Article VIII, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution exclusively vests in the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all courts and court personnel, from the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals down to the lowest municipal trial court clerk. By virtue of this power, it is only the Supreme Court that can oversee the judge's and court personnel's compliance with all laws, and take the proper administrative action against them if they commit any violation thereof. No other branch of government may intrude into this power, without running afoul of the doctrine of separation of powers.

            Public respondent Ombudsman cannot justify its investigation of a petitioner on the powers granted to it by the Constitution, for the Constitution granting supervisory powers to the Supreme Court over all courts and their personnel, but likewise undermines the independence of the judiciary. (Sanz Maceda v. Vasquez, G.R. No. 102781, April 22, 1993)

            The Office of the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction to initiate an investigation into the alleged "undue delay in the disposition of the case" as said charge relates to a judge's performance of her official duties over which the Supreme Court has administrative control and supervision, as mandated under Section 6, Rule VIII of the 1987 Constitution.

            It must be borne in mind that the resolution of the administrative charge of unduly delaying the disposition of the said criminal case involves the determination of whether, in resolving the alarms and scandals case, petitioner-judge acted in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Rules of Court and in the Administrative Circulars in pursuance of the ideals embodied in the Code of Judicial Conduct. Such is clearly an administrative matter. Unquestionably, this Court is mandated of the 1987 Constitution to assume under Section 6, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution to assume administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof.

            """<b>Rule-making Powers of the Supreme Court</b>
            The Supreme Court has the power to "promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the integrated bar, and legal assistance to the under- privileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court." (Section 5[5], Article VIII)

            Procedural matters, first and foremost, fall more squarely within the rule-making prerogative of the Supreme Court than the law-making power of Congress. The rule here announced additionally allowing an intermediate review by the Court of Appeals, a subordinate appellate court, before the case is elevated to the Supreme Court on automatic review, is such a procedural matter. (People v. Mateo, G.R. No. 147678-87, July 7, 2004)

            To begin with, Section 1 quite clearly requires that a reservation must be made to institute separately all civil actions for the recovery of civil liability, otherwise they will be deemed to have been instituted with the criminal case. Such civil actions are not limited to those which arise "from the offense charged," as originally provided in Rule III before the amendment of the Rules of Court in 1988. In other words the right of the injured party to sue separately for the recovery of the civil liability whether arising from crimes (ex delicto) or from quasi delict under Article 2176 of the Civil Code must be reserved otherwise they will be deemed instituted with the criminal action. 

            There are statements in some cases implying that Rule III. Sections 1 and 3 are beyond the rule making power of the Supreme Court under the Constitution. A careful examination of the cases, however, will show that approval of the filing of separate civil action for damages even though no reservation of the right to institute such civil action had been reserved rests on considerations other than that no reservation is needed. Indeed, the question on whether the criminal action and the action for recovery of the civil liability must be tried in a single proceeding has always been regarded a matter of procedure and, since the rule making power has been conferred by the Constitution on this Court, it is in the keeping of this Court.

        'content': [
            """<b>Writ of Amparo</b>
            The adoption of the Amparo Rule surfaced as a recurring proposition in the recommendations that resulted from a two- day National Consultative Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances sponsored by the Court on July 16-17 2007. The Summit was "envisioned to provide a broad and fact- based perspective on the issue of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances," hence "representatives from all sides of the political and social spectrum, as well as all the stakeholders in the justice system" participated in mapping out ways to resolve the crisis.

            On October 24, 2007, the Court promulgated the Amparo Rule "in light of the prevalence of extralegal killing and enforced disappearances." It was an exercise for the first time of the Court's expanded power to promulgate rules to protect our people's constitutional rights, which made its maiden appearance in the 1987 Constitution in response to the Filipino experience of the martial law regime. As the Amparo Rule was intended to address the intractable problem of "extralegal killings" and "enforced disappearances," its coverage, in its present form, is confined to these two instances or to threats thereof. "Extralegal killings" are "killings committed without due process of law, i.e., without legal safeguards or judicial proceedings." On the other hand, "enforced disappearances" are attended by the following characteristics: an arrest, detention, or abduction of a person by a government official or organized groups or private individuals acting with the direct or indirect acquiescence of the government; the refusal of the State to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty which places such persons outside the protection of law.

            The Writ of Amparo was originated in Mexico. "Amparo" literally means "protection" in Spanish. In 1837, de Tocqueville's Democracy in America became available in Mexico and stirred great interest. Its description of the practice of judicial review in the U.S. appealed to many Mexican jurists. One of them, Manuel Crescencio Rejón, drafted a constitutional provision for his native state, Yucatan, which granted judges the power to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their constitutional and legal rights.

            Since then, the protection has been an important part of Mexican constitutionalism. If, after hearing, the judge determines that a constitutional right of the petitioner is being violated, he orders the official, or the official's superiors, to cease the violation and to take the necessary measures to restore the petitioner to the full enjoyment of the right in question. Amparo thus combines the principles of judicial review derived from the U.S. with the limitations on judicial power characteristic of the civil law tradition which prevails in Mexico. It enables courts to enforce the constitution by protecting individual rights in particular cases, but prevents them from using this power to make law for the entire nation.

            The Writ of Amparo then spread throughout the Western Hemisphere, gradually evolving into various forms, in response to the particular needs of each country. It became, in the words of a justice of the Mexican Federal Supreme Court, one piece of Mexico's self-attributed "task of conveying to the world's legal heritage that institution which, as a shield of human dignity, her own painful history conceived." What began as a protection against rights later evolved for several purposes: (1) Amparo libertad acts or omissions of public authorities in violation of constitutional for the protection of personal freedom, equivalent to the habeas corpus writ; (2) Amparo contra leyes for the judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes; (3) Amparo casacion for the judicial review of the constitutionality and legality of a judicial decision; (4) Amparo administrativo for the judicial review of administrative actions; and (5) Amparo agrario for the protection of peasants' rights derived from the agrarian reform process.

            In Latin American countries, except Cuba, the Writ of Amparo has been constitutionally adopted to protect against human rights abuses especially committed in countries under military juntas. In general, these countries adopted an all-encompassing writ to protect the whole gamut of constitutional rights, including socio-economic rights. Other countries like Colombia, Chile, Germany and Spain, however, have chosen to limit the protection of the Writ of Amparo only to some constitutional guarantees or fundamental rights.

            In the Philippines, while the 1987 Constitution does not explicitly provide for the Writ of Amparo, several of the above Amparo protections are guaranteed by our charter. The second paragraph of Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution, the Grave Abuse Clause, provides for the judicial power "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government." The Clause accords a similar general protection to human rights extended by the Amparo contra leyes, Amparo casacion, and Amparo administrativo. Amparo libertad is comparable to the remedy of habeas corpus found in several provisions of the 1987 Constitution.

            While constitutional rights can be protected under the Grave Abuse Clause through remedies of injunction or prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court and a petition for habeas corpus pestering problem of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances. However, with the swiftness required to resolve a petition for a Writ of Amparo through summary proceedings and the availability of appropriate interim and permanent reliefs under the Amparo Rule, this hybrid writ of the common law and civil law traditions-borne out of the Latin American and Philippine experience of human enforced disappearances and threats thereof. The remedy provides rights abuses offers a better remedy to extralegal killings and requires only substantial evidence to make the appropriate reliefs rapid judicial relief as it partakes of a summary proceeding that available to the petitioner; it is not an action to determine criminal guilt requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, or liability for damages requiring preponderance of evidence, or administrative responsibility requiring substantial evidence that will require full and exhaustive proceedings.

            The Writ of Amparo serves both preventive and curative roles in addressing the problem of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances. It is preventive in that it breaks the expectation of impunity in the commission of these offenses; it is curative in that it facilitates the subsequent punishment of perpetrators as it will inevitably yield leads to subsequent investigation and action. In the long run, the goal of both the preventive and curative roles is to deter the further commission of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances. (Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo, G.R. No. 180906, October 7, 2008)

            """<b>Writ of Habeas Data</b> 
            A.M. No. 08-1-16-SC, or the Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data (Habeas Data Rule), was conceived as a response, given the lack of effective and available remedies, to address the extraordinary rise in the number of killings and enforced disappearances. It was conceptualized as a judicial remedy enforcing the right to privacy, most especially the right to informational privacy of individuals, which is defined as "the right to control the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of data about oneself."

            As defined in Section 1 of the Habeas Data Rule, the Writ of Habeas Data now stands as "a remedy available to any person whose right to privacy in life, liberty or security is violated or threatened by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of or storing of data or information regarding the person, family, a private individual or entity engaged in the gathering, collecting home, and correspondence of the aggrieved party." Thus, in order O support a petition for the issuance of such writ, Section 6 of the Habeas Data Rule essentially requires that the petition sufficiently alleges, among others, "the manner the right to privacy is violated or threatened and how it affects the right to life, liberty or security of the aggrieved party." In other words, the petition must adequately show that there exists a nexus between the right to privacy on the one hand, and the right to life, liberty or security on the other. Corollarily, the allegations in the petition must be supported by substantial evidence showing an actual or threatened violation of the right to privacy in life, liberty or security of the victim. In this relation, it bears pointing out that the Writ of Habeas Data will not issue to protect purely property or commercial concerns nor when the grounds invoked in support of the petitions therefor are vague and doubtful. (Lee v. Ilagan, G.R. No. 203254, October 8, 2014)

            The Writ of Habeas Data is a remedy available to any person whose right to privacy in life, liberty or security is violated or threatened by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private individual or entity engaged in the gathering, collecting or storing of data or information regarding the person, family, home and correspondence of the aggrieved party. It is an independent and summary remedy designed to protect the image, privacy, honor, information, and freedom of information of an individual, and to provide a forum to enforce one's right to the truth and to informational privacy. It seeks to protect a person's right to control information regarding oneself, particularly in instances in which such information is being collected through unlawful means in order to achieve unlawful ends.

            """<b>Decisions of the Court</b>
            Section 14. No decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.

            No petition for review or motion for reconsideration of a decision of the court shall be refused due course or denied without stating the legal basis therefor. (Section 14, Article VIII)

            It is a requirement of due process that the parties to a litigation be informed of how it was decided, with an explanation of the factual and legal reasons that led to the conclusions of the court. The court cannot simply say that judgment is rendered in favor of X and against Y and just leave it at that without any justification whatsoever for its action. The losing party is entitled to know why he lost, so he may appeal to a higher court, if permitted should he believe that the decision should be reversed. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is especially prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal.

            It is important to observe at this point that the constitutional provision does not apply to interlocutory orders, such as one granting a motion for postponement or quashing a subpoena, because it "refers only to decisions on the merits and not to orders of the trial court resolving incidental matters." The Court is not duty bound to render signed decisions all the time. It has ample discretion to formulate decisions and/or minute resolutions, provided a legal basis is given, depending on its evaluation of a case.

            Review by the Court of the other issues raised, most of which are factual, e.g., the allegation of default in the payment of the loan, the existence of a second loan, the nature of the newspapers where the notices of the sale were published, the authority of the person consenting to the postponement of the sale, etc., is impractical and unnecessary at this time. These matters should be discussed in detail in the revised order to be made by the trial court so that the higher courts will know what they are reviewing when the case is appealed.

            In one case, this Court, exasperated over the inordinate length of a decision rife with irrelevant details, castigated the trial judge for his "extraordinary verbiage." Kilometric decisions without much substance must be avoided, to be sure, but the other extreme, where substance is also lost in the wish to be brief, is no less unacceptable either. The ideal decision is that which, with welcome economy of words, arrives at the factual findings, reaches the legal conclusions, renders its ruling and, having done so, ends.

            """<b>Power to Control Execution of Decision</b>
            This Supreme Court has repeatedly declared in various decisions, which constitute jurisprudence on the subject, that in criminal cases, after the sentence has been pronounced and the period for reopening the same cannot change or alter its judgment, as its jurisdiction has terminated... When in cases of appeal or review the cause has been returned thereto for execution, in the event that the judgment has been affirmed, it performs a ministerial duty in issuing the proper order.

The particulars of the execution itself, judicial authority, while the executive has no power over the person of the convict except to provide for carrying out of the penalty and to pardon.

            Getting down to the solution of the question in the case at bar which is that of execution of a capital sentence, it must be accepted as a hypothesis that postponement of the date can be requested. There can be no dispute on this point. It is a well-known principle that notwithstanding the order of execution and the executory nature thereof on the date set or at the proper time, the date therefore can be postponed, even in sentences of death. Under the common law, this postponement can be ordered in three ways: (1) By command of the King; (2) by discretion (arbitrio) of the court; and (3) by mandate of the law. It is sufficient to state this principle of the common law to render impossible that assertion in absolute terms that after the convict has once been placed in jail the trial court cannot reopen the case to investigate the facts that show the need for postponement. If one of the ways is by direction of the court, it is acknowledged that even after the date of the execution has been fixed, and notwithstanding the general rule that after the (court) has performed its ministerial duty of ordering the execution... and its part is ended, if however a circumstance arises that ought to delay the execution, and there is an imperative duty to investigate the emergency and to order a postponement. Then the question arises as to whom the application for postponing the execution ought to be addressed while the circumstances is under investigation and so to who has jurisdiction to make the investigation.

            The power to control the execution of its decision is an essential aspect of jurisdiction. It cannot be the subject of substantial subtraction for our Constitution vests the entirety of judicial established by law. To be sure, the important part of a litigation, whether civil or criminal, is the process of execution of decisions where supervening events may change the circumstance parties and compel courts to intervene and adjust the rights of the litigants to prevent unfairness. It is because of these unforeseen supervening contingencies that courts have been conceded the inherent and necessary power of control of its processes and orders to make them conformable to law and justice. For this purpose, Section 6 of Rule 135 provides that, "when by law jurisdiction is conferred on a court or judicial officer, all auxiliary writs, processes and other means necessary to carry it into effect may be employed by such court or officer and if the procedure to be followed in the exercise of such jurisdiction is not specifically pointed out by law or adopted which appears conformable to the spirit of said law or rules," by these rules, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be It bears repeating that what the Court restrained temporarily is the execution of its own Decision to give it reasonable time to check its fairness in light of supervening events in Congress as alleged by petitioner. The Court, contrary to popular misimpression, did not restrain the effectivity of a law enacted by Congress.

            The more disquieting dimension of the submission of the public respondents that this Court has no jurisdiction to restrain the execution of petitioner is that it can diminish the independence of the judiciary. Since the implant of republicanism in our soil, our courts have been conceded the jurisdiction to enforce their final decisions. In accord with this unquestioned jurisdiction, this Court promulgated rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure which, among others, spelled out the rules on execution of judgments. These rules are all predicated on the assumption that courts have the inherent, necessary and incidental power to control and supervise the process of execution of their decisions. Rule 39 governs execution, satisfaction and effects of judgments in civil cases. Rule 120 governs judgments in criminal cases. It should be stressed that the power to promulgate rules of pleading, practice and procedure was granted by our Constitutions to this Court to enhance its independence, for in the words of Justice Isagani Cruz "without independence and integrity, courts will lose that popular trust so essential to the maintenance of their vigor as champions of justice." Hence, our Constitutions continuously vested this power to this Court for it enhances its independence. Under the 1935 Constitution, the power of this Court to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure was granted but it appeared to be co-existent with legislative power for it was subject to the power of Congress to repeal, alter or supplement.

            The Constitution expressly prohibits Congress from depriving the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction, as enumerated in Section 5, Article VII of the Constitution, or from passing a law that undermines the security of tenure of the members of the judiciary. The Constitution also mandates that the judiciary shall enjoy fiscal autonomy, and grants the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all courts and judicial personnel. Jurisprudence has characterized administrative supervision as exclusive, noting that only the Supreme Court can oversee the judges and court personnel's compliance with all laws, rules and regulations. No other branch of government may intrude into this power, without running afoul of the doctrine of separation of powers.

            The Constitution protects as well the salaries of the Justices and judges by prohibiting any decrease in their salary during their continuance in office, and ensures their security of tenure by providing that "Members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts shall hold office during good behavior until they reach the age of seventy years or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of their office." With these guarantees, justices and judges can administer justice undeterred by any fear of reprisals brought on by their judicial action. They can act inspired solely by their knowledge of the law and by the dictates of their conscience, free from the corrupting influence of base or unworthy motives. (Re: COA Opinion on the Computation of the Appraised Value of the Properties Purchased by the Retired Chief/Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, A.M. No. 11-7-10-SC, July 31, 2012)

            The Constitution does not speak in the language of ambiguity: "A public office is a public trust." That is more than a moral adjuration. It is a legal imperative. The law may vest in a public official certain rights. It does so to enable them to perform his functions and fulfill his responsibilities more efficiently. It is from that standpoint that the security of tenure provision to assure efficiently. It is from judicial independence is to be viewed. It is an added guarantee that justices and judges can administer justice undeterred by any fear of reprisal or untoward consequence. Their judgments then are even more likely to be inspired solely by their knowledge of the law and the dictates of their conscience, free from the corrupting influence of base or unworthy motives. The independence of which they are assured is impressed with a significance transcending that welfare. The challenged legislation is thus subjected to the most of a purely personal right. As thus viewed, it is not solely for their rigorous scrutiny by this Tribunal, lest by lack of due care and circumspection, it allows the erosion of that Ideal so firmly embedded in the national consciousness. There is this further thought to consider. Independence in thought and action necessarily is rooted in one's mind and heart. As emphasized by former Chief Justice Paras in Ocampo u. Secretary of Justice, there is no surer guarantee of judicial independence than the God-given character and fitness of those appointed to the Bench. The judges may be guaranteed a fixed tenure of office during good behavior, but if they are of such stuff as allows them to be subservient to one administration after another, or to cater to the wishes of one litigant after another, the independence of the judiciary will be nothing more than a myth or an empty Ideal. Our judges, we are confident, can be of the type of Lord Coke, regardless or in spite of the power of Congress to reorganize we do not say unlimited but as herein exercised - inferior courts." That is to recall one of the greatest Common Law jurists, who at the cost of his office made clear that he would not just blindly obey the King's order but "will do what becomes [him] as a judge." So it was pointed out in the first leading case stressing the independence of the judiciary, Borromeo v. Mariano, the ponencia of Justice Malcolm identified good judges with "men who have a mastery of the principles of law, who discharge their duties in accordance with law, who are permitted to perform the duties of the office undeterred by outside influence, and who are independent and self-respecting human units in a judicial system equal and coordinate to the other two departments of government." There is no reason to assume that the failure of this suit to annul Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 would be attended with deleterious consequences to the faith of the existing inferior courts except the Sandiganbayan and administration of justice. It does not follow that the abolition in good the Court of Tax Appeals and the creation of new ones will result in a judiciary unable or unwilling to discharge with independence its solemn duty or one recreant to the trust reposed in it. Nor should there be any fear that less than good faith will attend the exercise be of the appointing power vested in the Executive. It cannot be denied that an independent and efficient judiciary is something to the credit of any administration. Well and truly has it been said that the fundamental principle of separation of powers assumes, and justifiably so, that the three departments are as one in their determination to pursue the ideals and aspirations and to fulfilling the hopes of the sovereign people as expressed in the Constitution. There is wisdom as well as validity to this pronouncement of Justice Malcolm in Manila Electric Co. v. Pasay Transportation Company, a decision promulgated almost half a century ago: "Just as the Supreme Court, as the guardian of constitutional rights, should not sanction usurpations by any other department or the government, so should it as strictly confine its own sphere of influence to the powers expressly or by implication conferred on it by the Organic Act." To that basic postulate underlying our constitutional system, this Court remains committed. (De La Llana v. Alba, G.R. No. L-57883, March 12, 1982)

            <b>Notes:</b>
            The Constitution provides that justices and judges are appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Judicial and Bar Council, but the President is not empowered by the Constitution to discipline or remove judges and justices.

            As consistently ruled by the Supreme Court, it has administrative supervision over all courts and their personnel. This supervision includes the power to discipline members of the Judiciary. Rule 140 of the Rules of Court outlines the process by which judges and justices of lower courts shall be held to answer judge or justice brought before this Court is an administrative for any administrative liability. A disciplinary case against a proceeding. Thus, it is subject to the rules and principles governing administrative procedures.

            Section 1 of Rule 140 states that proceedings for the discipline of judges and justices of lower courts may be instituted in three ways: by the Supreme Court  motu proprio, through a verified complaint, and through an anonymous complaint. A verified complaint must be supported by affidavits of persons who have personal knowledge of the facts alleged or by documents which may substantiate the allegations. An anonymous complaint, on the other hand, should be supported by public records of indubitable integrity.

            Since a disciplinary case is an administrative proceeding. technical rules of procedure and evidence are not strictly applied and administrative due process cannot be fully equated with due process in its strict judicial sense. Administrative due process essentially means "an opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of." When the Court acts motu proprio, this opportunity arises through the filing of a comment upon order of the Court. In a case where the are initiated by a complaint, the Rules of Court state proceedings that the complaint must state the acts or omissions constituting a violation of our ethical rules. To our mind, this is the standard of what suffices as information as to the allegations against a respondent. It is sufficient that the acts or omissions complained of are clearly identified.

            We see no cogent reason in law or policy to depart from our time-tested procedure for the discipline of judges and justices of lower courts which allows complaints to be instituted in three ways: by the Court motu proprio, through a verified complaint, or through an anonymous complaint.

            Any citizen or member of the public who knows a judge who commits acts of immorality qualifies as, and has the civic duty to be, a complainant or a witness against the errant judge. These persons, usually members of the community whom the judge serves, have a direct interest in preserving the integrity of the judicial process and in keeping the faith of the public in the justice system. The harm inflicted by the judge upon the members of his family is distinct from the harm wreaked by an erring judge upon the judicial system. The family and the State are each imbued with the autonomy to exact their response to acts of immorality by a rogue judge. The State cannot intrude into the family's autonomy any more than the family cannot intrude upon the autonomy of the State. (Anonymous Complaint Judge Exequil L. Dagala, A.M.

            """<b>Members of the Supreme Court May Be Removed by Quo Warranto</b>
             While both impeachment and quo warranto may result in the ouster of the public official, the two proceedings materially differ. At its most basic, impeachment proceedings are political in nature, while an action for quo warranto is judicial or proceeding  traditionally lodged in the courts.

             In the Philippines, the earliest record of impeachment in our laws is from the 1935 Constitution. Compared to the US Constitution, it would appear that the drafters of the 1935 Constitution further modified the process by making impeachment applicable only to the highest officials of the country; providing "culpable violation of the Constitution" as an additional ground, and requiring two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives to impeach and three-fourths vote of the Senate to convict.

             As currently worded, our 1987 Constitution, in addition to those stated in the 1935 basic law, provided another additional ground to impeach high-ranking public officials: "betrayal of public trust." Commissioner Rustico De los Reyes of the 1986 Constitutional Commission explained this ground as "catch-all phrase to include all acts which are not punishable by statutes as penal offenses but, nonetheless, render the officer unfit to continue in office. It includes betrayal of public interest, inexcusable negligence of duty, tyrannical abuse of power, breach of official duty by malfeasance or misfeasance, cronyism, favoritism, etc. to the prejudice of public interest and which tend to bring the office into disrepute."

             Edward of England who questioned the local barons and lords who The oft-cited origin of quo warranto was the reign of King held lands or title under questionable authority. After his return from his crusade in Palestine, he discovered that England had fallen because of ineffective central administration by his predecessor. King Henry III. The inevitable result was that the barons, whose relations with the King were governed on paper by Magna Carta,  assumed to themselves whatever power the King's officers had neglected. Thus, King Edward deemed it wise to inquire as to what right the barons exercised any power that deviated in the slightest from normal type of feudalism that the King had in mind. The theory is that certain rights are regalia and can be exercised only upon showing of actual grants from the King or his predecessor. Verily, King Edward's purpose was to catalog the rights, properties and possessions of the kingdom in his efforts to restore the same.

             In the Philippines, the remedies against usurpers of public office appeared in the 1900s, through Act No. 190. Section 197 of the Act provides for provision comparable to Section 1, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court.

            Based from the foregoing, it appears that impeachment is proceeding exercised by the legislative, as representatives of the sovereign, to vindicate the breach of the trust reposed by the people in the hands of the public officer by determining the public officer's fitness to stay in the office. Meanwhile, an action for quo warranto, involves judicial determination of the eligibility or validity of the election or appointment of public official based on predetermined rules.

            Aside from the difference in their origin and nature, quo warranto and impeachment may proceed independently of each other as these remedies are distinct as to (1) jurisdiction, (2) grounds, (3) applicable rules pertaining to initiation, filing, and dismissal, and (4) limitations.

            The term "quo warranto" is Latin for "by what authority." Therefore, as the name suggests, quo warranto is writ of inquiry. It determines whether an individual has the legal right to hold the public office he or she occupies.

            Thus, quo warranto proceeding is the proper legal remedy to determine the right or title to the contested public office or to oust the holder from its enjoyment. In quo warranto proceedings referring to offices filled by election, what is to be determined is the eligibility of the candidates elected, while in quo warranto proceedings referring to offices filled by appointment, what is determined is the legality of the appointment.

            The title to public office may not be contested collaterally but only directly, by quo warranto proceedings. In the past, the Court held that title to public office cannot be assailed even through mandamus or motion to annul or set aside order. That quo warranto is the proper legal vehicle to directly attack title to public office  likewise precludes the filing of petition for prohibition for purposes of inquiring into the validity of the appointment of public officer.

            The remedies available in quo warranto judgment do not include correction or reversal of acts taken under the ostensible authority of an office or franchise. Judgment is limited to ouster or forfeiture and may not be imposed retroactively upon prior exercise of official or corporate duties.

            Quo warranto and impeachment are, thus, not mutually exclusive remedies and may even proceed simultaneously. The existence of other remedies against the usurper does not prevent the State from commencing quo warranto proceeding.

            We hold, therefore, that by its tenor, Section 2, Article XI of the Constitution allows the institution of quo warranto action against an impeachable officer. After all, quo warranto petition is predicated on grounds distinct from those of impeachment. The former questions the validity of public officer's appointment while the latter indicts him for the so-called impeachable offenses without questioning his title to the office he holds.

            Further, that the enumeration of "impeachable offenses" is made absolute, that is, only those enumerated offenses are treated as grounds for impeachment, is not equivalent to saying that the enumeration likewise purport to be complete statement of the causes of removal from office.

            The salary of the Chief Justice and of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, and of judges of lower courts, shall be fixed by law. During their continuance in office, their salary shall not be decreased. (Section 10, Article VIII)

            The Constitution protects as well the salaries of the Justices and judges by prohibiting any decrease in their salary during their continuance in office, and ensures their security of tenure by providing that "Members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts shall hold office during good behavior until they reach the age of seventy years or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of their office." With these guarantees, justices and judges can administer justice undeterred by any fear of reprisals brought on by their judicial action. They can act inspired solely by their knowledge of the law and by the dictates of their conscience, free from the corrupting influence of base or unworthy motives.

            """<b>Judicial Salary Is Not Tax Exempt</b>
            The provision in the 1987 Constitution, which petitioners rely on, reads: "The salary of the Chief Justice and of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, and of judges of lower courts shall be fixed by law. During their continuance in office, their salary shall not be decreased."

            The 1987 Constitution does not contain a provision similar to Section 6, Article XV of the 1973 Constitution, for which reason, petitioners claim that the intent of the framers is to revert to the original concept of "non-diminution" of salaries of judicial officers.

            It is plain that the Constitution authorizes Congress to pass a law fixing another rate of compensation of Justices and Judges but such rate must be higher than that which they are receiving at the time of enactment, or if lower, it would be applicable only to those appointed after its approval. It would be a strained construction to read into the provision an exemption from taxation in the light of the discussion in the Constitutional Commission.

            With the foregoing interpretation, and as stated heretofore, the ruling that "the imposition of income tax upon the salary of judges is a diminution thereof, and so violates the Constitution" in Perfecto v. Meer, as affirmed in Endencia v. David must be declared discarded. The framers of the fundamental law, as the alter ego of the people, have expressed in clear and unmistakable terms the meaning and import of Section 10, Article VIII, of the 1987 Constitution that they have adopted.

            Stated otherwise, we accord due respect to the intent of the people, through the discussions and deliberations of their representatives, in the spirit that all citizens should bear their aliquot part of the cost of maintaining the government and should share the burden of general income taxation equitably.

            """<b>Introduction</b>
            As the lyrics of a 1977 song goes - "nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky" (Dust in the Wind, Kansas, 1977). The constitution as the foundation of the nation must be stable and firm but it must be relevant to the needs of the times. Thus, it must not stand still, and accommodate the needs of the changing times.

            Any amendment to, or revision of, this Constitution may be proposed by: (1) The Congress, upon a vote of three-fourths of all its Members; or (2) A constitutional convention. (Section 1, Article XVII)

            There can be no mistake about it. The framers of the Constitution intended, and wrote, a clear distinction between amendment and revision of the Constitution. The framers intended, and wrote, that only Congress or a constitutional convention may propose revisions to the Constitution. The framers intended, and wrote, that a people's initiative may propose only amendments to the Constitution. Where the intent and language of the Constitution clearly withhold from the people the power to propose revisions to the Constitution, the people cannot propose revisions even as they are empowered to propose amendments. (Lambino v. Comelec, G.R. No. 174153, October 25, 2006) 
            """,
            """<b>Amendment</b> 
            An amendment is essentially a correction. It comes in many varieties, up to and including the process of altering something through either parliamentary or constitutional procedure. (https:// www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment/ - accessed date: 10/27/2020)

            Amendment broadly refers to a change that adds, reduces, or deletes without altering the basic principle involved. Revision generally affects several provisions of the constitution, while amendment generally affects only the specific provision being amended.

            Article XVII of the Constitution speaks of three modes of amending the Constitution. The first mode is through Congress upon three-fourths vote of all its Members. The second mode is through a constitutional convention. The third mode is through a people's initiative. (Lambino v. Comelec, G.R. No. 174153, October 25, 2006)
            """,
            """<b>Revision</b>
            Revision broadly implies a change that alters a basic principle in the constitution, like altering the principle of separation of powers or the system of checks-and-balances. There is also revision if the change alters the substantial entirety of the constitution, as when the change affects substantial provisions of the constitution.

            Since a revision of a constitution affects basic principles or several provisions of a constitution, a deliberative body with recorded proceedings is best suited to undertake a revision. A revision requires harmonizing not only several provisions but also the altered principles with those that remain unaltered. Thus, constitutions normally authorize deliberative bodies like constituent assemblies or constitutional conventions to undertake revisions. (Lambino v. Comelec, G.R. No. 174153, October 25, 2006)

            """<b>Tests to Determine Whether the Proposal Is Amendment or Revision</b>
            The Supreme Court in the case of Lambino v. Comelec citing the California Constitution ruled that there are two tests to determine whether the proposed changes to the constitution would constitute amendments or revision- the <b>quantitative test</b> and the <b>qualitative test.</b>
            """,
            """<b>Quantitative Test</b> 
            The quantitative test looks into the number of provisions of the constitution that are proposed to be changed or amended. The more provisions to be changed would constitute revision.

            This test asks whether the proposed change is "so extensive in its provisions as to change directly the 'substantial entirety' of the constitution by the deletion or alteration of numerous existing provisions." The court examines only the number of provisions affected and does not consider the degree of the change. (Lambino v. Comelec, G.R. No. 174153, October 25, 2006)

            """<b>Qualitative Test</b>
            The qualitative test inquires into the qualitative effects of the proposed change in the constitution. The main inquiry is whether the change will "accomplish such far reaching changes in the nature of our basic governmental plan as to amount to a revision." Whether there is an alteration in the structure of government is a proper subject of inquiry. Thus, "a change in the nature of [the] basic governmental plan" includes "change in its fundamental framework or the fundamental powers of its Branches." A change in the nature of the basic governmental plan also includes changes that "jeopardize the traditional form of government and the system of check and balances." (Lambino v. Comelec, G.R.

            """<b>Quantitative Test vs. Qualitative Test</b>
            Under both the quantitative and qualitative tests, the Lambino Group's initiative is a revision and not merely an amendment. Quantitatively, the Lambino Group's proposed changes overhaul two articles Article VI on the Legislature and Article VII on the Executive affecting a total of 105 provisions in the entire Constitution. Qualitatively, the proposed changes alter substantially the basic plan of government, from presidential to parliamentary, and from a bicameral to a unicameral legislature.

            A change in the structure of government is a revision of the Constitution, as when the three great co-equal branches of government in the present Constitution are reduced into two. This alters the separation of powers in the Constitution. A shift from the present Bicameral-Presidential system to a Unicameral Parliamentary system is a revision of the Constitution. Merging the legislative and executive branches is a radical change in the structure of government.

            The abolition alone of the Office of the President as the locus of Executive Power alters the separation of powers and thus constitutes chamber of Congress alters the system of checks-and-balances a revision of the Constitution. Likewise, the abolition alone of one within the legislature and constitutes a revision of the Constitution.

            By any legal test and under any jurisdiction, a shift from a Bicameral-Presidential to a Unicameral-Parliamentary system, involving the abolition of the Office of the President and the abolition of one chamber of Congress, is beyond doubt a revision, not a mere amendment. On the face alone of the Lambino Group's proposed changes, it is readily apparent that the changes will radically alter the framework of government as set forth in the Constitution. Father Joaquin Bernas, S.J., a leading member of the Constitutional Commission, writes: An amendment envisages an alteration of one intention of an amendment is to improve specific parts or to add new or a few specific and separable provisions. The guiding original provisions deemed necessary to meet new conditions or to suppress specific portions that may have become obsolete or that are judged to be dangerous. In revision, however, the guiding original intention and plan contemplates a re-examination of the entire document, or of provisions of the document which have over-all implications for the entire document, to determine how and to what extent they should be altered. Thus, for instance a switch from the presidential system to a parliamentary system would be a revision because of its over- all impact on the entire constitutional structure. So would a switch from a bicameral system to a unicameral system be because of its effect on other important provisions of the Constitution. (Lambino v. Comelec, G.R. No. 174153, October 25, 2006)

            In amending or revising the constitution, the constitution itself provides steps that must be strictly followed by those proposing such amendments or revisions - proposal and ratification.

            The two steps complement each other in a scheme intended to achieve a single objective. It is to be noted that the amendatory provided process as in the Philippine Constitution "consists of two distinct parts: proposal and ratification." There is no logic in attaching political character to one and withholding that character from the other. Proposal to amend the Constitution is a highly political function performed by the Congress in its sovereign legislative capacity and committed to its charge by the Constitution itself. The exercise of this power is even independent of any intervention by the Chief Executive. (Mabanag v. Lopez Vito, G.R. No. L-1123, March 5, 1947)

            According to Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 6735, initiative is the power of the people to propose amendments to the Constitution or to propose and enact legislations through an election called for the purpose. There are three systems of initiative, namely: 1) Initiative on the Constitution which refers to a petition proposing amendments to the Constitution; 2) Initiative on statutes which refers to a petition proposing to enact a national legislation; and 3) Initiative on local legislation which refers to a petition proposing to enact a regional, provincial, city, municipal, or barangay law, resolution or ordinance.

            The Supreme Court ruled in Lambino v. Comelec that Section 2, Article XVII of the Constitution is the governing constitutional provision that allows a people's initiative to propose amendments to the Constitution.

            Article XVII of the Constitution speaks of three modes of amending the Constitution. The first mode is through Congress upon three-fourths vote of all its Members. The second mode is through a constitutional convention. The third mode is through a people's initiative. Section 1 of Article XVII, referring to the first and second modes, applies to any amendment to, or revision of, this Constitution. In contrast, Section 2 of Article XVII, referring to the third mode, applies only to "amendments to this Constitution." This distinction was intentional as shown by the following deliberations of the Constitutional Commission. On the other hand, constitutions allow people's initiatives, which do not have fixed and identifiable deliberative bodies or recorded proceedings, to undertake only amendments and not revisions. (Lambino v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 174153, October 25, 2006)

            """<b>Republic Act No. 6735</b> 
            This law is known as the Initiative and Referendum Act. It was provision on people's initiative to amend the Constitution pursuant enacted in 1989 for the purpose of implementing the constitutional to Section 2, Article XVII of the 1987 Constitution that Congress shall provide for the implementation of the exercise of this right.

            We agree that Republic Act No. 6735 was, as its history reveals, intended to cover initiative to propose amendments to the  Constitution. But, is Republic Act No. 6735 a full compliance with the power and duty of Congress to provide for the implementation of the exercise of the right? A careful scrutiny of the Act yields a negative answer.

            First, contrary to the assertion of public respondent Commission on Elections, Section 2 of the Act does not suggest an initiative on amendments to the Constitution.

            Second, it is true that Section 3 (Definition of Terms) of the Act defines initiative on amendments to the Constitution and mentions it as one of the three systems of initiative, and that Section 5 (Requirements) restates the constitutional requirements as to the percentage of the registered voters who must submit the proposal. But unlike in the case of the other systems of initiative, the Act does not provide for the contents of a petition for initiative on the Constitution. Section 5(c) requires, among other things, statement of the proposed law sought to be enacted, approved or rejected, amended or repealed, as the case may be. It does not include, as among the contents of the petition, the provisions of the Constitution sought to be amended, in the case of initiative on the Constitution.

            Third, while the Act provides subtitles for National Initiative and Referendum (Subtitle II) and for Local Initiative and Referendum (Subtitle III), no subtitle is provided for initiative on the Constitution. This conspicuous silence as to the latter simply means that the main thrust of the Act is initiative and referendum on national and local laws. If Congress intended Republic Act No. 6735 to fully provide for the implementation of the initiative on amendments to the Constitution, it could have provided for a subtitle therefore, considering that in the order of things, the primacy of interest, or hierarchy of values, the right of the people to directly propose amendments to the Constitution is far more important than the initiative on national and local laws.

            Upon the other hand, as to initiative on amendments to the Constitution, Republic Act No. 6735, in all of its 23 sections, merely a) mentions, the word "Constitution" in Section 2; b) defines "initiative on the Constitution" and includes it in the enumeration of the three systems of initiative in Section 3; c) speaks of "plebiscite" as the process by which the proposition is an initiative on the Constitution may be approved or rejected by the people; d) reiterates the constitutional requirements as to the number of voters who should sign the petition; and e) provides for the date of effectivity of the approved proposition.

            There was, therefore, an obvious downgrading of the more important or the paramount system of initiative. Republic Act No. 6735, thus, delivered a humiliating blow to the system of initiative on amendments to the Constitution by merely paying it a reluctant lip service. The foregoing brings us to the conclusion that Republic Act No. 6735 is incomplete, inadequate, or wanting in essential terms and conditions in so far as initiative on amendments to the Constitution is concerned. Its lacunae on this substantive matter are fatal and cannot be cured by "empowering" the COMELEC "to promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act." Republic Act No. 6735 is inadequate to cover the system of initiative on amendments to the Constitution, and to have failed to provide sufficient standard for subordinate legislation. (Santiago v. Comelec, G.R. No. 127325, March 19, 1997)

            """<b>Ratification</b>
            Ratification means the confirmation of a previous act done either by the party himself or another; as, confirmation of a voidable act. It pertains to the approval by the electorate of a proposed constitutional amendment. (Black's Law Dictionary, Centennial Edition, pp. 1261-1262) Ratification is the final step where the voters as sovereign people shall be the one to approve or reject the proposed amendments or revisions of the Constitution.

            The 1987 Constitution provides that any amendment to, or revision of, the Constitution under Section 1, i.e. thru constituent assembly or constitutional convention shall be valid when ratified by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite which shall be held not earlier than 60 days nor later than 90 days after the approval of such amendment or revision.

            On the other hand, any amendment under Section 2, through people's initiative shall be valid when ratified by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite which shall be held not earlier than 60 days nor later than 90 days after the certification by the Commission on Elections of the sufficiency of the petition.

            """<b>Doctrine of Proper Submission</b>
            That proper submission of amendments to the people to enable them to equally ratify them properly is the meat of the constitutional requirement, is reflected in the sequence of uniform past practices. At no time, however, was the vote for the amendments of the Constitution held simultaneously with the election officials, national or local. In the end, we say that the people are the last ramparts that guard against indiscriminate changes in the Constitution that is theirs. Is it too much to ask that reasonable guarantee be made that in the matter of the alterations of the law of the land, their true voice be heard? The answer perhaps is best expressed in the following thoughts: "It must be remembered that the Constitution is the people's enactment. No proposed change can become effective unless they will it so, through the compelling force of need of it and desire for it." (Gonzales v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. L-28196, November 9, 1967)

            The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government. Who is to determine the nature, scope, and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them. This is in truth all that is involved in what is termed "judicial supremacy" which properly is the power of judicial review under the Constitution.

            Even then, this power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very lis mota presented. Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to strike this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom. conclusions unrelated to actualities. Narrowed as its functions in justice, or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.

            But much as we might postulate on the internal checks of power provided in our Constitution, it ought not the less to be remembered that, in the language of James Madison, the system itself is not "the chief palladium of constitutional liberty... the people who are authors of this blessing must also be its guardians... their eyes must be ever ready to mark, their voices to pronounce... aggression on the authority of their Constitution." In the last and ultimate analysis then, must the success of our government in the unfolding years to come be tested in the crucible of Filipino minds and hearts than in consultation rooms and court chambers.

            We are certain, no one can deny that in order that a plebiscite for the ratification of an amendment to the Constitution may be validly held, it must provide the voter not only sufficient time but ample basis for an intelligent appraisal of the nature of the amendment per se as well as its relation to the other parts of the Constitution with which it has to form a harmonious whole. In the context of the present state of things, where the Convention has hardly started considering the merits of hundreds, if not thousands, of proposals to amend the existing Constitution, to present to the people any single proposal or a few of them cannot comply with this requirement.

            """<b>Judicial Review of Amendmen</b> 
            In the cases of Javellana v. Executive Secretary, G.R. No. L-36142, March 31, 1973 and Sanidad v. Comelec, G.R. No. L-44640, October 12, 1976, which were decided at the time of martial rule in the country, the Supreme Court held that the amendments to the 1973 Constitution and subsequent ratification by the people are beyond the powers of judicial review as they are in the nature of political question.

            If there is any significance, both explicit and implicit, and certainly unmistakable, in the foregoing pronouncements, it is that the step taken in connection with the ratification of the Constitution was meant to be irreversible, and that nothing anyone could say assessment of the situation, then we would say that since it has would make the least difference. And if this is a correct and accurate been brought about by political action and is now maintained by the government that is in undisputed authority and dominance, the matter lies beyond the power of judicial review.

            In the deliberations of this Court one of the issues formulated for resolution is whether or not the new Constitution, since its submission to the Citizens Assemblies, has found acceptance among the people, such issue being related to the political question theory propounded by the respondents. We have not tarried on the point at all since we find no reliable basis on which to form a judgment. Under a regime of martial law, with the free expression of opinions through the usual media vehicles restricted, we have no means of knowing, to the point of judicial certainty, whether the people have accepted the Constitution. In any event, we do not find the issue decisive in so far as our vote in these cases is concerned. To interpret the Constitution- that is judicial. That the Constitution should be deemed in effect because of popular acquiescence - that is political and therefore beyond the domain of judicial review. (Javellana u Executive Secretary, G.R. No. L-36142, March 31, 1973)

            But it is hoped that if confronted by the same questions under the 1987 Constitution, the Supreme Court will no longer rule in the same manner and would take cognizance of these issues based on the expanded power of judicial review provided in the Section 1. Article VIII, 1987 Constitution.

            A commission is defined as "a board or committee officially appointed and empowered to perform certain acts or exercise certain jurisdiction of a public nature or relation. Noteworthy, the CSC is composed of a chairman and two commissioners; the COMELEC, a chairman and six commissioners; and the COA, a chairman and two commissioners. Clearly provided in Section 7 is that these three constitutional commissions shall decide by a majority vote of all its members any case or matter brought before it; thus, the commissions are collegial bodies whose manner of working is characterized by a sharing of responsibility among the chairman and the commissioners of the commission.

            Section 1. The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be independent, are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on Audit. (Section 1, Article IX-A)

            Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution expressly describes all the Constitutional Commissions as independent. Although their respective functions are essentially executive in nature, they are not under the control of the President of the Philippines in the discharge of such functions. Each of the Constitutional Commissions conducts its own proceedings under the applicable laws and its own rules and in the exercise of its own discretion. Its decisions, orders and rulings are subject only to review on certiorari by the Court as provided by Section 7, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution. (Funa v. The Chairman, Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 191672, November 25, 2014)

            To the point of being monotonous, Article IX of the 1987 Constitution refers exclusively to the constitutional commissions; thus, such proscription as to the appointment or designation in a temporary or acting capacity of a member applies only to the constitutional commissions and cannot extend to the Ombudsman and the deputies. Indeed, Article XI of the Constitution does not provide for such prohibition. What is clear however, is that the Ombudsman and the deputies shall, during their tenure, be subject to the same disqualifications and prohibitions as provided for in Section 2 of Article IX(A) of this Constitution, "no Member of a Constitutional Commission shall, during his tenure, hold any other office or employment. Neither shall he engage in the practice of any profession or in the active management or control of any business which in any way may be affected by the functions of his office, nor shall he be financially interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract with, or in any franchise or privilege granted by the Government, any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries."

            """<b>Appointment and Term of Office</b>
            The Chairman and the Commissioners shall be appointed by the President with the consent of the Commission on Appointments for a term of seven years without reappointment. Of those first appointed, the Chairman shall hold office for seven years, a Commissioner for five years, and another Commissioner for three years, without reappointment. Appointment to any vacancy shall be only for the unexpired term of the predecessor. In no case shall any Member be appointed or designated in a temporary or acting capacity. (Section 1[2], Article IX-B, Section 1[2], Article IX-D)

            To sum up, the Court restates its ruling on Section 1(2), Article IX(D) of the Constitution, viz.:

            1. The appointment of members of any of the three constitutional commissions, after the expiration of the uneven terms of office of the first set of commissioners, shall always be for a fixed term of seven (7) years; an appointment for a lesser period is void and unconstitutional. The appointing authority cannot validly shorten the full term of seven (7) years in case of the expiration of the term as this will result in the distortion of the rotational system prescribed by the Constitution.

            2. Appointments to vacancies resulting from certain causes (death, resignation, disability or impeachment) shall only be for the unexpired portion of the term of the predecessor, but such appointments cannot be less than the unexpired portion as this will likewise disrupt the staggering of terms laid down under Sec. 1(2), Art. IX(D).

            3. Members of the Commission, e.g., COA, COMELEC or CSC, who were appointed for a full term of seven years and who served the entire period, are barred from reappointment to any position in the Commission. Corollarily, the first appointees in the Commission under the Constitution are also covered by the prohibition against reappointment.

            4. A commissioner who resigns after serving in the Commission for less than seven years is eligible for an appointment to the position of Chairman for the unexpired portion of the term of the departing chairman. Such appointment is not covered by the ban on reappointment, provided that the aggregate period of the length of service as commissioner and the unexpired period of the term of the predecessor will not exceed seven (7) years and provided further that the vacancy in the position of Chairman resulted from death, resignation, disability or removal by impeachment. The Court clarifies that "reappointment" found in Sec. 1(2), Art. IX(D) means a movement to one and the same office (Commissioner to Commissioner or Chairman to Chairman). On the other hand, an appointment involving a movement to a different position or office (Commissioner to Chairman) would constitute a new appointment and, hence, not, in the strict legal sense, a reappointment barred under the Constitution.

            5. Any member of the Commission cannot be appointed or designated in a temporary or acting capacity. (Funa v. The Chairman of the Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 192791, April 24, 2012)

            No member of a Constitutional Commission shall, during his tenure, hold any other office or employment. Neither shall he engage in the practice of any profession or in the active management or control of any business which, in any way, may be affected by the functions of his office, nor shall he be financially interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract with, or in any franchise or privilege granted by the Government, any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled  corporations or their subsidiaries. (Section 2, Article IX-A)

            The underlying principle for the resolution of the present controversy rests on the correct application of Section 1 and Section 2, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution, which provide:

            Section 1. The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be independent, are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on Audit.

            Section 2. No Member of a Constitutional Commission shall, during his tenure, hold any other office or employment. Neither shall he engage in the practice of any profession or in the active management or control of any business which in any way may be affected by the functions of his office, nor shall he be financially interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract with, or in any franchise or privilege granted by the Government, any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government- owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.

            Section 1, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution expressly describes all the Constitutional Commissions as "independent." Although their respective functions are essentially executive in nature, they are not under the control of the President of the Philippines in the discharge of such functions. Each of the Constitutional Commissions conducts its own proceedings under the applicable laws and its own rules and in the exercise of its own discretion. Its decisions, orders and rulings are subject only to review on certiorari by the Court as provided by Section 7, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution.

            To safeguard the independence of these Commissions, the 1987 Constitution, among others, imposes under Section 2, Article IX-A of the Constitution certain inhibitions and disqualifications upon the Chairmen and members to strengthen their integrity, to wit: (a) Holding any other office or employment during their tenure; (b) Engaging in the practice of any profession; (c) Engaging in the active management or control of any business which in any way may be affected by the functions of his office; and (d) Being financially interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract with, or in any franchise or privilege granted by the Government, any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government- owned or -controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.

            Each Commission shall decide by a majority vote of all its Members, any case or matter brought before it within 60 days from the date of its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the Commission or by the Commission itself. Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within 30 days from receipt of a copy thereof.

            Under Article IX(A), Section 7 of the Constitution, which petitioner cites in support of this petition, it is stated: "Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each (Constitutional) Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof." On the other hand, private respondent relies on Article IX(C), Section 2(2), paragraph 2 of the Constitution which provides that decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Commission on Elections in contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable.

            We resolve this issue in favor of the petitioner. The fact that decisions, final orders or rulings of the Commission on Elections in contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices are final, executory and not appealable, does not preclude a recourse to this Court by way of a special civil action of certiorari. The proceedings in the Constitutional Commission on this matter are enlightening. (Galido v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 95346, January 18, 1991)

            The civil service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters. (Section 2[1], Article IX-B)

            The Constitution grants to the CSC administration over the entire civil service. As defined, the civil service embraces every branch, agency, subdivision, and instrumentality of the government, including every government-owned or controlled corporation. It is further classified into career and non-career service positions. Career service positions are those where: (1) entrance is based on merit and fitness or highly technical qualifications; (2) there is opportunity for advancement to higher career positions; and (3) there is security of tenure. These include: (1) Open Career positions for appointment to which prior qualification in an appropriate examination is required; (2) Closed Career positions which are scientific, or highly technical in nature; these include the faculty and academic staff of state colleges and universities, and scientific and technical positions in scientific or research institutions which shall establish and maintain their own merit systems; (3) Positions in the Career Executive Service; namely, Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Director, Assistant Bureau Director, Regional Director, Assistant Regional Director, Chief of Department Service, and other officers of equivalent rank as may be identified by the Career Executive Service Board, all of whom are appointed by the President; (4) Career officers, other than those in the Career Executive Service, who are appointed by the President, such as the Foreign Service Officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs; (5) Commissioned officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces which shall maintain a separate merit system; (6) Personnel of government-owned or controlled corporations, whether performing governmental or proprietary functions, who do not fall under the non-career service; and (7) Permanent laborers, whether skilled, semi-skilled, or unskilled.

            Entrance to the first two levels is determined through competitive Career positions are further grouped into three levels. examinations, while entrance to the third level is prescribed by the Career Executive Service Board. The positions covered by each level are: (a) The first level shall include clerical, trades, crafts, and custodial service positions which involve non-professional or subprofessional work in a non-supervisory or supervisory capacity requiring less than four years of collegiate studies; (b) The second level shall include professional, technical, and scientific positions which involve professional, technical, or scientific work in a non- supervisory or supervisory capacity requiring at least four years of college work up to Division Chief level; and (c) The third level shall cover positions in the Career Executive Service.

            On the other hand, non-career service positions are characterized by: (1) entrance not by the usual tests of merit and fitness; and (2) tenure which is limited to a period specified by law, coterminous with the appointing authority or subject to his pleasure or limited to the duration of a particular project for which purpose employment was made. The Non-Career Service shall include: (1) Elective officials and their personal or confidential staff; (2) Secretaries and other officials of Cabinet rank who hold their positions at the pleasure of the President and their personal or confidential staff(s); (3) Chairman and members of commissions and boards with fixed terms of office and their personal or confidential staff; (4) Contractual personnel or those whose employment in the government is in accordance with a special contract to undertake a specific work or job, requiring special or technical skills not available in the employing agency, to be accomplished within a specific period, which in no case shall exceed one year, and performs or accomplishes the specific work or job, under his own responsibility with a minimum of direction and supervision from the hiring agency; (5) Emergency and seasonal personnel. (The Civil Service Commission v. Sojor, G.R. No. 168766, May 22, 2008)

            As the central personnel agency of the Government, the Civil Service Commission administers the Civil Service Law. It is, therefore, the single arbiter of all contests relating to the civil service. The discharge of this particular function was formerly lodged in one of its offices, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) which was vested with the power, among others, "to hear and decide on appeal administrative cases involving officials and employees of the civil service and its decision shall be final except those involving dismissal or separation from the service which may be appealed to the Commission." However, with the issuance of Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 93-2387 on June 29, 1992 such appeals shall now be filed directly with the Civil Service Commission. (Department of Health v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 113212, December 29, 1995) 

            Thus, while all other appointive officials in the civil service  are allowed to hold other office or employment in the government during their tenure when such is allowed by law or by the primary functions of their positions, members of the Cabinet, their deputies, and assistants may do so only when expressly authorized by the Constitution itself. In other words, Section 7, Article IX-B is meant to lay down the general rule applicable to all elective and appointive public officials and employees, while Section 13, Article VII is meant to be the exception applicable only to the President, the Vice- President, Members of the Cabinet, their deputies and assistants.

            """,
            """<b>The Power of Appointment</b> 
            The issue is starkly simple: Is the Civil Service Commission authorized to disapprove a permanent appointment on the ground that another person is better qualified than the appointee and, on the basis of this finding, order his replacement by the latter?

            The Civil Service Commission is not empowered to determine the kind or nature of the appointment extended by the appointing officer, its authority being limited to approving or reviewing the appointment in the light of the requirements of the Civil Service Law. When the appointee is qualified and authorizing the other legal requirements are satisfied, the Commission has no choice but to attest to the appointment in accordance with the Civil Service Laws.

            Indeed, the approval is more appropriately called an attestation, that is, of the fact that the appointee is qualified for the position to which he has been named. As we have repeatedly held, such attestation is required of the Commissioner of Civil Service merely as a check to assure compliance with Civil Service Laws.

            Appointment is an essentially discretionary power and must be performed by the officer in which it is vested according to his best lights, the only condition being that the appointee should possess the qualifications required by law. If he does, then the appointment cannot be faulted on the ground that there are others better qualified who should have been preferred. This is a political question involving considerations of wisdom that only the appointing authority can decide. (Luego v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. L-69137, August 5, 1986)

            We declare once again, and let us hope for the last time, that the Civil Service Commission has no power of appointment except over its own personnel. Neither does it have the authority to review the appointments made by other offices except only to ascertain if the appointee possesses the required qualifications. The determination of who among aspirants with the minimum statutory qualifications should be preferred belongs to the appointing authority and not the Civil Service Commission. It cannot disallow an appointment because it believes another person is better qualified and much less can it direct the appointment of its own choice.

            Appointment is a highly discretionary act that even this Court cannot compel. While the act of appointment may in proper cases be the subject of mandamus, the selection itself of the appointee- taking into account the totality of his qualifications, including those is the prerogative abstract qualities that define his personality - is the prerogative of the appointing authority. This is a matter addressed only to the discretion of the appointing authority. It is a political question that the Civil Service Commission has no power to review under the Constitution and the applicable laws. (Lapinid v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 96298, May 14, 1991)

            """<b>Appeals from the Decisions of the Civil Service Commission</b> 
            As provided by Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, the proper mode of appeal from the decision of a quasi-judicial agency, like the CSC, is a Petition for Review filed with the Court of Appeals. The special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court may be resorted to only when any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its/his jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. (Mahinay v. Court of Appeals, April 30, 2008)

            Thus, we now hold that the parties adversely affected by a decision in an administrative case who may appeal shall include the disciplining authority whose decision dismissing the employee was either overturned or modified by the Civil Service Commission.

            Thus, under the present legal milieu, disciplining authorities have the right to appeal CSC decisions which have modified the penalty originally meted against erring government personnel. If it were otherwise, the government would be deprived of its right  to weed out undeserving public servants. Consequently, the PAO had legal standing to appeal the decision reinstating Atty. Recto- Sambajon to her former post, whom it previously found unfit to continue as a public attorney. (Sambajon v. Public Attorney's Office, G.R. No. 197745, September 6, 2017)

            There shall be a Commission on Elections composed of a Chairman and six Commissioners who shall be natural-born citizens of the Philippines and, at the time of their appointment, at least 35 years of age, holders of a college degree, and must not have been candidates for any elective positions in the immediately preceding elections. However, a majority thereof, including the Chairman, shall be members of the Philippine Bar who have been engaged in the practice of law for at least 10 years. (Section 1[1], Article IX-C)

            Corollary to these provisions in the 1987 Constitution, the terms of the first chairmen and commissioners of the constitutional commissions must start on a common date, irrespective of the variations in the dates of appointments and qualifications of the appointees, in order that the expiration of the first terms of seven, five, and three years should lead to the regular recurrence of the two-year interval between the expiration of the terms.

            Decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Commission on Elections contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable. (Section 2[2], Article IX-C)

            It is clear from the above-quoted provision of the 1987 Constitution that election cases include pre-proclamation controversies and all such cases must first be heard and decided by a Division of the Commission. The Commission, sitting en banc, does not have the authority to hear and decide the same at the first instance. In the COMELEC RULES OF PROCEDURE, pre- proclamation cases are classified as Special Cases and, in compliance with the above provision of the Constitution, the two Divisions of the Commission are vested with the authority to hear and decide these Section 9 of the said Rule provides that appeals from rulings of the Special Cases. Rule 27 thereof governs Special Cases; specifically, Board of Canvassers are cognizable by any of the Divisions to which e assigned and not by the Commission en banc.

All such election cases shall be heard and decided in division, provided that motions for reconsideration of decisions shall be decided by the Commission en banc. (Section 3, Article IX-C)

            The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials and has appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective municipal officials decided by trial courts of general jurisdiction or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction. (Article IX[C], Section 2[2], paragraph 1 of the 1987 Constitution)

            In the present case, after a review of the trial court's decision, the respondent COMELEC found that 15 ballots in the same precinct containing the letter "C" after the name Galido are clearly marked ballots. May this COMELEC decision be brought to this court by a petition for certiorari by the aggrieved party (the herein petitioner)? Under Article IX(A), Section 7 of the Constitution, which petitioner cites in support of this petition, it is stated: "Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each (Constitutional) Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof."

            On the other hand, private respondent relies on Article IX(C), Section 2(2), paragraph 2 of the Constitution which provides that decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Commission on Elections in contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable.

            We resolve this issue in favor of the petitioner. The fact that decisions, final orders or rulings of the Commission on Elections in contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices are final, executory and not appealable, does not preclude a recourse to this Court by way of a special civil action of certiorari. The proceedings in the Constitutional Commission on this matter are enlightening. (Galido v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 95346, January 18, 1991)

            The Court en banc has held in Rodillas v. COMELEC that, "the procedure for perfecting an appeal from the decision of the Municipal Trial Court in a barangay election protest case is set forth in the COMELEC Rules of Procedure." More recently, in Calucag u Commission on Elections, the Court en banc had occasion to state that: "It follows that after the promulgation of Flores, the same arguments propounded therein by the petitioner may no longer be employed. Article 8 of the Civil Code states that, "judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the constitution shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines." Said pronouncement of the Court, having formed part of the law of the land, ignorance thereof can no longer be countenanced. Therefore, the COMELEC is the proper appellate court clothed with jurisdiction to hear the appeal, which appeal must be filed within five days after the promulgation of the MTC's decision. The erroneous filing of the appeal with the RTC did not toll the running of the prescriptive period... The five- day period having expired without the aggrieved party filing the appropriate appeal before the COMELEC, the statutory privilege of petitioner to appeal is deemed waived and the appealed decisions has become final and executory."

            """<b>Regional Trial Court Has No Jurisdiction</b>
            The RTC had absolutely no jurisdiction over the appeal interposed by the private respondent from the decision of the MTC.

            Under paragraph (2), Section 2, subdivision C, Article IX of the Constitution, it is the COMELEC, and not the Regional Trial Courts, that has exclusive jurisdiction over all contests involving elective barangay officials decided by courts of limited jurisdiction, which are the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts. In Flores v. Commission on Elections, this Court struck out as unconstitutional that portion of Section 9 of Republic Act No. 6679 vesting upon the Regional Trial Courts appellate jurisdiction over such cases.

            The private respondent should have appealed the decision of the MTC to the COMELEC; the MTC should not have given due course to the appeal; and the RTC should have dismissed outright the appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Guieb v. Fontanilla, G.R. No. 118118, August 14, 1995)

            Section 7. Each Commission shall decide by a majority vote of all its Members any case or matter brought before it within sixty days from the date of its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the Commission or by the Commission itself. Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof.

            In the instructive case of Ambil v. Commission on Elections, we have interpreted the provision to limit the remedy of certiorari against final orders, rulings and decisions of the COMELEC en banc rendered in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers. Certiorari will not generally lie against an order, ruling, or decision of a COMELEC division for being premature, taking into account the availability of the plain, speedy and adequate remedy of a motion for reconsideration. As elucidated in the case: Rule 65, Section 1, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, requires that there be no appeal, or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. A motion for reconsideration is a plain and adequate remedy provided by law. Failure to abide by this procedural requirement constitutes a ground for dismissal of the petition. In like manner, a decision, order or resolution of a division of the Comelec must be reviewed by the Comelec en banc via a motion for reconsideration before the final en banc decision may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari. The pre-requisite filing of a motion for reconsideration is mandatory. The above doctrine further gained force when it was reiterated in our recent ruling in Cagas v. COMELEC, in which we held that a party aggrieved by an interlocutory order issued by a Division of the COMELEC in an protest may not directly assail the said order in this Court through a special civil action for certiorari. The remedy is to seek the review of the interlocutory order during the appeal of the decision of the Division in due course. (Villarosa v. Festin, G.R. No. 212953, August 5, 2014)

            There is no parity between the petition for review under Rule 42 and the petition for certiorari under Rule 64.

            As to the nature of the procedures, Rule 42 governs an appeal from the judgment or final order rendered by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. Such appeal is on a question of fact, or of law, or of mixed question of fact and law, and is given due course only upon a prima facie showing that the Regional Trial Court committed an error of fact or law warranting the reversal or modification of the challenged judgment or final order. In contrast, the petition for certiorari under Rule 64 is similar to the petition for certiorari under Rule 65, and assails a judgment or final order of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), or the Commission on Audit (COA). The petition is not designed to correct only errors of jurisdiction, not errors of judgment. Questions of fact cannot be raised except to determine whether the COMELEC or the COA was guilty of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

            The reglementary periods under Rule 42 and Rule 64 are different. In the former, the aggrieved party is allowed 15 days to file the petition for review from receipt of the assailed decision or final order, or from receipt of the denial of a motion for new trial or reconsideration. In the latter, the petition is filed within 30 days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed. The filing of a motion for new trial or reconsideration, if allowed under the procedural rules of the Commission concerned, interrupts the period; hence, should the motion be denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the remaining period. which shall not be less than five days in any event, reckoned from the notice of denial.

            Thus, in the light of this constitutionally delegated task, the courts must exercise caution when intervening with disputes involving these independent bodies, for the general rule is that before a party may seek the intervention of the court, he should first avail of all the means afforded him by administrative processes. The issues which administrative agencies are authorized to decide should not be summarily taken from them and submitted to a court without first giving such administrative agency the opportunity to dispose of the same after due deliberation.

Except for the period for bringing the petition for review, Rule 64 is a replication of the provisions of Rule 65 on the special civil action for certiorari.

(Dorman B. Eaton, The "Spoils" System and Civil Service Reform, Chapter III. The Merit System)

            Based on Section 1, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, "Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives."

            Indeed, in a democratic country like the Philippines where the people are sovereign and the government officials are supposed to be public servants, occupying a public office is based on the trust reposed on the occupants of public offices by the people.

            Public office is a public trust. All government officials and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. This constitutional mandate should always be in the minds of all public servants to guide them in their actions during their entire tenure in the government service.

            Upon appointment to a public office, an officer or required to take his oath of office whereby he solemnly swears to employee is support and defend the Constitution, bear true faith and allegiance to the same; obey the laws, legal orders and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities; and faithfully discharge to the best of his ability the duties of the position he will hold.

            Yet, time and again, we hear of public servants acting in utter defiance of the principles enshrined in the Constitution and in complete disregard of what they swore in the name of God before assuming their posts in the public service. Consequently, the people's trust and faith in the government has slowly eroded. There is very little respect and confidence left.

            This in turn has resulted in a widespread feeling of disappointment and dissatisfaction in the government machinery. Gone are the days when one of the shining ambitions of a college graduate was to have a career in the civil service; when working in the government meant self-fulfillment. Now, young and talented graduates shy away from the public service which is unfortunately perceived to be unattractive and totally lacking in luster. It is only when those in the government sector serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency and act in accordance with the tenets of the Constitution can such lost respect and confidence be regained. This case is typical of what a public servant should not be. (City Mayor of Zamboanga v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 80270, February 27, 1990)

            Impeachment proceeding is not a single act. It is a complexus of acts consisting of a beginning, a middle, and an end. The end is the transmittal of the articles of impeachment to the Senate. The middle consists of those deliberative moments leading to the formulation of the articles of impeachment.

            """<b>Impeachable Officers and Grounds for Impeachment</b>
            The President, the Vice-President, the Members of the Supreme Court, the Members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman may be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, or betrayal of public trust. All other public officers and employees may be removed from office as provided by law, but not by impeachment. (Section 2, Article XI)

            Although Section 2 of Article XI of the Constitution enumerates six grounds for impeachment, two of these, namely, other high crimes and betrayal of public trust, elude a precise definition. In fact, an examination of the records of the 1986 Constitutional Commission shows that the framers could find no better way to approximate the boundaries of betrayal of public trust and other high crimes than by alluding to both positive and negative examples of both, without arriving at their clear cut definition or even a standard therefor. Clearly, the issue calls upon this court to decide a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power under Section 1, Article VIII. (Francisco v. The House of Representatives, G.R. No. 160261, November 10, 2003)

            """<b>Procedure for Impeachment</b>
            Section 3 of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution enumerated the steps to be undertaken in an impeachment process, to wit:

            (1) The House of Representatives shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment.

            (2) A verified complaint for impeachment may be filed by any Member of the House of Representatives or by any citizen upon a resolution or endorsement by any Member thereof, which shall be included in the Order of Business within ten session days, and referred to the proper Committee within three session days thereafter. The Committee, after hearing, and by a majority vote of all its Members, shall submit its report to the House within sixty session days from such referral, together with the corresponding resolution. The resolution shall be calendared for consideration by the House within ten session days from receipt thereof.

            (3) A vote of at least one-third of all the Members of the House shall be necessary either to affirm a favorable resolution with the Articles of Impeachment of the Committee, or override its contrary resolution. The vote of each Member shall be recorded.

            (4) In case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the Members of the House, the same shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment, and trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed.

            (5) No impeachment proceedings shall be initiated against the same official more than once within a period of one year.

            (6) The Senate shall have the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment. When sitting for that purpose, the Senators shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President of the Philippines is on trial, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside, but shall not vote. No person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.

            (7) Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office and disqualification to hold any office under the Republic of the Philippines, but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to prosecution, trial, and punishment, according to law.

            (8) The Congress shall promulgate its rules on impeachment to effectively carry out the purpose of this section.

            """<b>Impeachment Result and Criminal Prosecution</b>
            We reject his argument that he cannot be prosecuted for the reason that he must first be convicted in the impeachment proceedings. The impeachment trial of petitioner Estrada was aborted by the walkout of the prosecutors and by the events that led to his loss of the presidency. Indeed, on February 7, 2001, the Senate passed Senate Resolution No. 83 "Recognizing that the Impeachment Court is Functus Officio." Since, the Impeachment Court is now functus officio, it is untenable for petitioner to demand that he should first be impeached and then convicted before he can be prosecuted. The plea if granted, would put a perpetual bar against his prosecution. Such a submission has nothing to commend itself for it will place him in a better situation than a non-sitting President who has not been subjected to impeachment proceedings and yet can be the object of a criminal prosecution. To be sure, the debates in the Constitutional Commission make it clear that when impeachment proceedings have become moot due to the resignation of the President, the proper criminal and civil cases may already be filed against him. (Estrada v. Arroyo, G.R. No. 146738, March 2, 2001)

            Petitioner contends that this Court disregarded Section 3(7) of Article XI of the Constitution which provides: (7) Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office and disqualification to hold any office under the Republic of the Philippines, but the party convicted should nevertheless be liable and subject to prosecution, trial and punishment according to law.

            Petitioner reiterates the argument that he must be first convicted in the impeachment proceedings before he could be criminally prosecuted. A plain reading of the provision will not yield this conclusion. The provision conveys two uncomplicated ideas: first, it tells us that judgment in impeachment cases has a limited reach... i.e., it cannot extend further than removal from office and disqualification to hold any office under the Republic of the Philippines, and second, it tells us the consequence of the limited reach of a judgment in impeachment proceedings considering its nature, i.e., that the party convicted shall still be liable and subject to prosecution, trial and punishment according to law. No amount of manipulation will justify petitioner's non sequitur submission that the provision requires that his conviction in the impeachment proceedings is a condition sine qua non to his prosecution, trial and punishment for the offenses he is now facing before the respondent Ombudsman.

            Petitioner contends that the private and public prosecutors' walk out from the impeachment proceedings "should be considered failure to prosecute on the part of the public and private prosecutors, and the termination of the case by the Senate is equivalent to acquittal." He explains "failure to prosecute" as the "failure of the prosecution to prove the case, hence dismissal on such grounds is a dismissal on the merits." He then concludes that "dismissal of a case for failure to prosecute amounts to an acquittal for purposes of applying the rule against double jeopardy." Without ruling on the nature of impeachment proceedings, we reject petitioner's submission. (Estrada v. Desierto, G.R. Nos. 146710-15, April 3, 2001)

        'content': [
            """<b>Impeachment and Double Jeopardy</b>
            Prescinding from these facts, petitioner cannot invoke double jeopardy. Double jeopardy attaches only: (1) upon a valid complaint; (2) before a competent court; (3) after arraignment; (4) when a valid plea has been entered; and (5) when the defendant was or convicted or the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated acquitted without the express consent of the accused. Assuming arguendo that the first four requisites of double jeopardy were complied with, petitioner failed to satisfy the fifth requisite for he was not acquitted nor was the impeachment proceeding dismissed without his express consent. Petitioner's claim of double jeopardy cannot be predicated on prior conviction for he was not convicted by the impeachment court. At best, his claim of previous acquittal may be scrutinized in light of a violation of his right to speedy trial, which amounts to a failure to prosecute. As Bernas points out, a failure to prosecute, which is what happens when the accused is not given a speedy trial, means failure of the prosecution to prove the case. Hence, dismissal on such grounds is a dismissal on the merits.

            Petitioner did not move for the dismissal of the impeachment case against him. Even assuming arguendo that there was a move for its dismissal, not every invocation of an accused's right to speedy trial is meritorious. While the Court accords due importance to an accused's right to a speedy trial and adheres to a policy of speedy administration of justice, this right cannot be invoked loosely. Unjustified postponements which prolong the trial for an unreasonable length of time are what offend the right of the accused to speedy trial. The following provisions of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure are apropos.

            Nor can the claim of double jeopardy be grounded on the dismissal or termination of the case without the express consent of the accused. We reiterate that the impeachment proceeding was closed only after the petitioner had resigned from the presidency, thereby rendering the impeachment court functus officio. By resigning from the presidency, petitioner more than consented to the termination of the impeachment case against him, for he brought about the termination of the impeachment proceedings. We have consistently ruled that when the dismissal or termination of the case is made at the instance of the accused, there is no double jeopardy.

            Petitioner stubbornly clings to the contention that he is entitled to absolute immunity from suit. His arguments are merely recycled and we need not prolong the longevity of the debate o n the subject. In our Decision, we exhaustively traced the origin of executive immunity in our jurisdiction and its bends and turns up to the present time. We held that given the intent of the 1987 Constitution to breathe life to the policy that a public office is a public trust, the petitioner, as a non-sitting President, cannot claim executive immunity for his alleged criminal acts committed while a sitting President. Petitioner's rehashed arguments including their thinly disguised new spins are based on the rejected contention that he is still President, albeit, a President on leave. His stance that his immunity covers his entire term of office or until June 30, 2004 disregards the reality that he has relinquished the presidency and there is now a new de jure President.

            Section 4. The present anti-graft court known as the Sandiganbayan shall continue to function and exercise its jurisdiction as now or hereafter may be provided by law. (Section 4, Article XI)

            The Sandiganbayan is a special collegial court that has jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and other offenses committed by public officers and employees, including those in government-owned or government controlled corporations. The special court was established by Presidential Decree No. 1486. It was subsequently modified by Presidential Decree No. 1606 and by Republic Act No. 7975 and Republic Act No. 8249. The Sandiganbayan currently sits in seven divisions of three justices each, based on Republic Act No. 10660.
            """,
            """<b>Jurisdiction</b>
            The Sandiganbayan shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:

            a. Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII, Book II of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense: (1) Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as Grade 27 and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (Republic Act No. 6758), specifically including: (2) Members of Congress and officials thereof classified as Grade '27' and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989; (3) Members of the judiciary without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution; (4) Chairmen and members of the Constitutional Commissions, without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution; and (5) All other national and local officials classified as Grade 27 and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.

            b. Other offenses or felonies whether simple or complex with other crimes committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection a of this section in relation to their office.

            c. Civil and criminal cases filed pursuant to and in connection with Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14, and 14-A, issued in 1986. (Section 2, Republic Act No. 10660)

            On the issue on jurisdiction, it is of no moment that Inocentes does not occupy a position with a salary grade of 27 since he was the branch manager of the GSIS' field office in Tarlac City, a government-owned or controlled corporation, at the time of the commission of the offense, which position falls within the coverage of the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction.

            The applicable law provides that violations of Republic Act No. 3019 committed by presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government owned or controlled corporations, and state universities shall be within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. We have clarified the provision of law defining the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan by explaining that the Sandiganbayan maintains its jurisdiction over those officials specifically enumerated in (a) to (g) of Section 4(1) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended, regardless of their salary grades. Simply put, those that are classified as Salary Grade 26 and below may still fall within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, provided they hold the positions enumerated by the law. In this category, it is the position held, not the salary grade, which determines the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Furthermore, as the Sandiganbayan correctly held, even low-level management positions fall under the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. (Inocentes v. People, G.R. No. 205963-64, July 7, 2016)

            """<b>The Crime Must Be Connected with the Discharge of Official Functions</b>
            In People v. Magallanes, where the jurisdiction between the Regional Trial Court and the Sandiganbayan was at issue, we ruled: It is an elementary rule that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information and not by the result of evidence after trial.

            In People v. Montejo we held that the offense charged was committed in relation to the office of the accused because it was perpetrated while they were in the performance, though improper or irregular of their official functions and would not have been committed had they not held their office, besides, the accused had no personal motive in committing the crime thus, there was an intimate connection between the offense and the office of the accused.

            Unlike in Montejo, the information in Criminal Cases Nos. 15562 and 15563 in the court below do not indicate that the accused arrested and investigated the victims and then killed the latter in the course of the investigation. The information merely allege that the accused for the purpose of extracting or extorting the sum of P353,000.00 abducted, kidnapped, and detained the two victims, and failing in their common purpose they shot; and killed the said victims. For the purpose of determining jurisdiction, it is these allegations that shall control, and not the evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial.

            In the aforecited case of People v. Montejo, it is noteworthy that the phrase committed in relation to public office does not appear in the information, which only signifies that the said phrase is not what determines the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. What is controlling is the specific factual allegations in the information that would indicate the close intimacy between the discharge of the accused's official duties and the commission of the offense charged, in order to qualify the crime as having been committed in relation to public office.

            Consequently, for failure to show in the amended information that the charge of murder was intimately connected with the discharge of official functions of the accused PNP officers, the offense charged in the subject criminal cases is plain murder and, therefore, within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court, not the Sandiganbayan.

A separate Deputy for the military establishment may likewise be appointed. (Section 5, Article XI)

            The word ombudsman comes from the Swedish ombudsman, meaning "legal representative."

The Ombudsman and the deputies do not resolve cases by a majority of all its members but rather are confined within the sphere of their respective jurisdiction, i.e., the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, for cases involving public officials and employees assigned in Luzon; the Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas, for those assigned in Visayas; the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao, for those assigned in Mindanao; the Deputy Ombudsman for MOLEO, for those assigned in the military and the police; and the Special Prosecutor, in the conduct preliminary investigation and prosecution of criminal cases within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.

(Section 4, Republic Act No. 6770)
            """,
            """<b>Jurisdiction of the Ombudsman</b>
            Thus, we construed Republic Act No. 6770, the Ombudsman law. The Ombudsman shall investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient act or omission of any public officer or employee, office, or agency over cases within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.

            This way, every word contained in Section 15, Republic Act No. 6770, is given effect. It is a "well-established rule in legal hermeneutics that in interpreting a statute, care should be taken that every part or word thereof be given effect since the lawmaking body is presumed to know the meaning of the words employed in the statute and to have used them advisedly." The meaning of any law is not to be extracted from any single part or from an isolated clause or sentence. There must be a general consideration of the act as a whole. Every part of the statute must be considered together and kept subservient to the general intent of the enactment, not separately and independently. The cardinal rule in statutory construction is "that the particular words, clauses, and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole. A statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible."

            Under the Article XI, Section 13 of the Constitution, the powers of the Office of the Ombudsman can be categorized as investigatory, directory, and recommendatory. The power to investigate includes only the power to conduct "an inquiry, judicial or otherwise, for the discovery and collection of facts concerning the matter or matters involved." The power to direct involves the power to "guide, order, command or instruct." The power to recommend includes the power to give "advice, exhortation or indorsement, which is essentially persuasive in character, not binding upon the party to whom it is made." This grant of powers by the Constitution is consistent with the function of an "Ombudsman," to wit: It is an independent, high level officer who receives complaints, who pursues inquiries into the matters involved and who makes recommendations for suitable action. He makes periodic reports. His remedial weapons are persuasion, criticism and publicity. "Beholden to no one, he acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of public service."

            However, the grant of power outside the essential powers prescribed in the Constitution (i.e., investigatory, directory, and recommendatory) must be expressed and strictly construed. Thus, the power to prosecute cases cognizable by regular courts cannot be implied. When a power is not essential to the accomplishment of the principal purposes for which that power was created, it cannot be granted by implication.

            We note that while the Ombudsman law grants the Ombudsman the power to prosecute criminal cases within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, it is silent as to whether the Ombudsman can prosecute cases within the jurisdiction of the regular courts. The Ombudsman law expressly identifies the Sandiganbayan as the venue where it can exercise prosecutorial powers of cases involving public officers within its original jurisdiction.

            Clearly then, the Ombudsman does not have the power to prosecute criminal cases within the original jurisdiction of the regular courts. In all cases elevated to the Sandiganbayan and from the Sandiganbayan to the Supreme Court, the Office of the Ombudsman, through its special prosecutor, shall represent the People of the Philippines, except in cases filed pursuant to Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A, issued in 1986. (Uy v. The Hon. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 105965-70, March 20, 2001)

            There is no gainsaying the fact that the Office of the Ombudsman is vested with the jurisdiction to take cognizance of cases for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not public servants have committed administrative offenses. However, their power is  only to recommend to the disciplining authority the appropriate authority penalty to be meted out and it is best left to the proper disciplining authority  to impose such penalty, which in this case is the Office of the Governor of the Province of Samar.

            Although the tenor of the text in Section 13(3), Article XI of the Constitution merely indicates a "recommendatory" function, this does not divest Congress of its plenary legislative power to vest the Ombudsman powers beyond those stated in the Constitutional provision. Pursuant to Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise known as The Ombudsman Act of 1989, the Ombudsman is legally authorized to directly impose administrative penalties against errant public servants. Further, the manifest intent of the lawmakers was to bestow on the Ombudsman full administrative disciplinary authority in accord with the constitutional deliberations. Unlike the Ombudsman-like agencies of the past, the powers of which extend to no more than making findings of fact and recommendations, and the Ombudsman or Tanodbayan under the 1973 Constitution who might file and prosecute criminal, civil or administrative cases against public officials and employees only in cases of failure of justice, the current Ombudsman, under the 1987 Constitution and Republic Act No. 6770, is intended to play a more active role in the enforcement of laws on anti-graft and corrupt practices and other offenses committed by public officers and employees. The Ombudsman is to be an "activist watchman," not merely a passive one. He is vested with broad powers to enable him to implement his own actions. (Office of the Ombudsman v. Quimbo, G.R. No. 173277, February 25, 2015)

            In our recent ruling in Office of the Ombudsman v. Court of Appeals, we reiterated Ledesma and expounded that taken together, the relevant provisions of Republic Act 6770 vested petitioner with "full administrative disciplinary authority" including the power to "determine the appropriate penalty imposable on erring public officers or employees as warranted by the evidence, and, necessarily. impose the said penalty," thus: The provisions in Republic Act No. 6770 taken together reveal the manifest intent of the lawmakers to bestow on the Office of the Ombudsman full administrative disciplinary authority. These provisions cover the entire gamut of administrative adjudication which entails the authority to, inter alia, receive complaints, conduct investigations, hold hearings in accordance with its rules of procedure, summon witnesses and require the production of documents, place under preventive suspension public officers and employees pending an investigation, determine the appropriate penalty imposable on erring public officers or employees as warranted by the evidence, and, necessarily, impose the said penalty.

            We see no reason to deviate from these rulings. They are consistent with our earlier observation that unlike the "classical Ombudsman model" whose function is merely to "receive and process the people's complaints against corrupt and abusive government personnel," the Philippine Ombudsman, as protector of the people, is armed with the power to prosecute erring public officers and employees, giving him an active role in the enforcement of laws on anti-graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses that may be committed by such officers and employees. The legislature has vested him with broad powers to enable him to implement his own actions. (Office of the Ombudsman v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 167844, November 22, 2006)

            At the outset, the Court emphasizes that as a general rule, factual findings of the Ombudsman are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence and are accorded due respect and weight, especially when affirmed by the CA. (Office of the Ombudsman v. Espina, G.R. No. 213500, March 15, 2017)          
            """,
            """<b>Office of the Special Prosecutor</b>
            The Office of the Special Prosecutor shall be composed of the Special Prosecutor and his prosecution staff. The Office of the Special Prosecutor shall be an organic component of the Office of the Ombudsman and shall be under the supervision and control of the Ombudsman. (Section 11[3], Republic Act No. 6770)

            Moreover, the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman should not be equated with the limited authority of the Special Prosecutor under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6770. The Office of the Special Prosecutor is merely a component of the Office of the Ombudsman and may act only under the supervision and control and upon the authority of the Ombudsman. Its power to conduct preliminary investigation and prosecute is limited to criminal cases within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Certainly, the lawmakers did not intend to confine the investigatory and prosecutory power of the Ombudsman to these types of cases. The Ombudsman is mandated by law to act on all complaints against officers and employees of the government and to enforce their administrative, civil and criminal liability in every case where the evidence warrants. To carry out this duty, the law allows him to utilize the personnel in his office and/or designate any fiscal, state prosecutor or lawyer in the government service to act as special investigator or prosecutor to assist in the investigation and prosecution of certain cases. Those designated or deputized to assist him work under his supervision and control. The law likewise allows him to direct the Special Prosecutor to prosecute cases outside the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction in accordance with Section 11(4c) of Republic Act No. 6770.

            The Court has consistently held that the Office of the Special Prosecutor is merely a component of the Office of the Ombudsman and may only act under the supervision and control and upon authority of the Ombudsman. (Office of the Ombudsman v. Valera, G.R. No. 164250, September 30, 2005)

Desierto, where the Court held that Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770, which provides that all "orders, directives, or decisions [in administrative cases] of the Office of the Ombudsman may be appealed to the Supreme Court by filing a petition for certiorari within 10 days from receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision or denial of the motion for reconsideration in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court," was unconstitutional for it increased the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court without its advice and concurrence. The Court thus held that "appeals from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under the provisions of Rule 43." (Gatchalian v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 229288, August 1, 2018)

            In the Fabian case, we ruled that appeals from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. It bears stressing that when we declared Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 as unconstitutional, we categorically stated that said provision is involved only whenever an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 is taken from a decision in an administrative disciplinary action. It cannot be taken into account where an original action for certiorari under Rule 65 is resorted to as a remedy for judicial review such as from an incident in a criminal action. In fine, we hold that the present petition should have been filed with this Court. It follows that the instant petition was filed late. A petition for certiorari should be filed not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution sought to be assailed. (Kuizon v. Desierto, G.R. Nos. 140619-24, March 9, 2001)

            The crux of the matter is whether the CA has jurisdiction over decisions and orders of the Ombudsman in criminal cases. This issue has been directly addressed in Kuizon v. Desierto and reiterated in the more recent Golangco v. Fung, wherein the Court declared that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over orders, directives and decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases only. It cannot, therefore, review the orders, directives or decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in criminal or non-administrative cases.

            It is settled that a judgment rendered by a court without jurisdiction over the subject matter is void. Since the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction over decisions and orders of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, its ruling on the same is void.

            The question that arises next is what remedy should an aggrieved party avail of to assail the Ombudsman's finding of the existence or lack of probable cause in criminal cases or non- administrative cases. In Estrada v. Desierto, the Court emphasized that parties seeking to question the resolutions of the Office of the Ombudsman in criminal cases or non-administrative cases, may file an original action for certiorari with this Court, not with the CA, when it is believed that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion. (Office of the Ombudsman v. Ventura, G.R. No. 151800, November 5, 2009)

            The threshold legal issue to be resolved in the instant petition, therefore, is whether or not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain original petitions for certiorari from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in criminal cases. In Tirol, Jr. v. Del Rosario, we had occasion to rule that Republic Act No. 6770 does not provide for the remedy of appeal from decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal or non-administrative cases. The aggrieved party may instead avail himself of the original petition for certiorari when the circumstances would warrant the use thereof: As we ruled in Fabian, the aggrieved party is given the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals. Such right of appeal is not granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions the Ombudsman in criminal cases, like finding probable cause to indict accused persons.

            However, an aggrieved party is not without recourse where the finding of the Ombudsman as to the existence of probable cause is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. An aggrieved party may file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.

            In the Fabian case, we ruled that appeals from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. It bears stressing that when we declared Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 as unconstitutional, we categorically stated that said provision is involved only whenever an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 is taken from a decision in an administrative disciplinary action.

In fine, we hold that the present petition should have been filed with this Court. (Estrada v. Desierto, G.R. No. 156160, December 9, 2004)

            """<b>Power over Elected Officials</b>
            The determination of whether the Ombudsman under Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise known as the Ombudsman Act of 1989, has been divested of his authority to conduct administrative investigations over local elective officials by virtue of the subsequent enactment of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, is the pivotal issue before the Court in this petition.

            The authority to conduct administrative investigation and to impose preventive suspension over elective provincial or city officials was at that time entrusted to the Minister of Local Government until it became concurrent with the Ombudsman upon the enactment of Republic Act No. 6770, specifically under Sections 21 and 24 thereof, to the extent of the common grant. The Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160), in fine, did not effect a change from what already prevailed, the modification being only in the substitution of the Secretary (the Minister) of Local Government by the Office of the President.

            Respondent local officials contend that the six-month preventive suspension without pay under Section 24 of the Ombudsman Act is much too repugnant to the 60-day preventive suspension provided by Section 63 of the Local Government Code to even now maintain its application. The two provisions govern differently. In order to justify the preventive suspension of a public official under Section 24 of Republic Act No. No. 6770, the evidence of guilt should be strong, and (a) the charge against the officer or employee should involve dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; (b) the charges should warrant removal from the service; or (c) the respondent's continued stay in office would prejudice the case filed against him. The Ombudsman can impose the six-month preventive suspension to all public officials, whether elective or appointive, who are under investigation. Upon the other hand, in imposing the shorter period of 60 days of preventive suspension prescribed in the Local Government Code of 1991 on an elective local official (at any time after the issues are joined), it would be enough that (a) there is reasonable ground to believe that the respondent has committed the act or acts complained of, (b) the evidence of culpability is strong, (c) the gravity of the offense so warrants, or (d) the continuance in office of the respondent could influence the witnesses or pose a threat to the safety and integrity of the records and other evidence.

            """<b>Powers Concurrent with the Department of Justice</b>
            In summation, the Constitution, Section 15 of the Ombudsman Act of 1989 and Section 4 of the Sandiganbayan Law, as amended, do not give to the Ombudsman exclusive jurisdiction to investigate offenses committed by public officers or employees. The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is concurrent with other government investigating agencies such as provincial, city and state prosecutors. However, the Ombudsman, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, may take over, at any stage, from any investigating agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.

            In other words, respondent DOJ Panel is not precluded from conducting any investigation of cases against public officers involving violations of penal laws but if the cases fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, then respondent Ombudsman may, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction take over at any stage.

            Thus, with the jurisprudential declarations that the Ombudsman and the DOJ have concurrent jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation, the respective heads of said offices came up with OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001 for the proper guidelines of their respective prosecutors in the conduct of their investigations.

            """<b>Ombudsman Has No Investigative Power over the Judiciary</b>
            Article VIII, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution exclusively vests in the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all courts and court personnel, from the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals down to the lowest municipal trial court clerk. By virtue of this power, it is only the Supreme Court that can oversee the judges' and court personnel's compliance with all laws, and take the proper administrative action against them if they commit any violation thereof. No other branch of government may intrude into this power, without running afoul of the doctrine of separation of powers.

            The Ombudsman cannot justify its investigation of petitioner on the powers granted to it by the Constitution, for such a justification not only runs counter to the specific mandate of the Constitution granting supervisory powers to the Supreme Court over all courts and their personnel, but likewise undermines the independence of the judiciary.

            Thus, the Ombudsman should first refer the matter of petitioner's certificates of service to this Court for determination of whether said certificates reflected the true status of his pending case load, as the Court has the necessary records to make such a determination. The Ombudsman cannot compel this Court, as one of the three branches of government, to submit its records, or to allow its personnel to testify on this matter, as suggested by public respondent Abiera in his affidavit-complaint.

            The rationale for the foregoing pronouncement is evident in this case. Administratively, the question before us is this: should a judge, having been granted by this Court an extension of time to decide cases before him, report these cases in his certificate of service? As this question had not yet been raised with, much less resolved by, this Court. how could the Ombudsman resolve the present criminal complaint that requires the resolution of said question?

            In fine, where a criminal complaint against a Judge or other court employee arises from their administrative duties, the Ombudsman must defer action on said complaint and refer the same to this Court for determination whether said Judge or court employee had acted within the scope of their administrative duties. (Sanz Maceda v. Vasquez, G.R. No. 102781, April 22, 1993)

            The Office of the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction to initiate an investigation into the alleged "undue delay in the disposition of the case" as said charge relates to a judge's performance of her official duties over which the Supreme Court has administrative control and supervision, as mandated under Section 6, Rule VIII of the 1987 Constitution.

            It must be borne in mind that the resolution of the administrative charge of unduly delaying the disposition of the said criminal case involves the determination of whether, in resolving the alarms and scandals case, petitioner-judge acted in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Rules of Court and in the Administrative Circulars in pursuance of the ideals embodied in the Code of Judicial Conduct. Such is clearly an administrative matter. Unquestionably, this Court is mandated of the 1987 Constitution to assume under Section 6, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution to assume administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof.

            """<b>Ombudsman for the Military</b>
            A separate Deputy for the military establishment may likewise be appointed. (Section 5, Article XI)

            The Deputy Ombudsman for the Military, despite his designation as such, is by no means a member of the military establishment. The said Office was established "to extend the Office of the Ombudsman to the military establishment just as it champions the common people against bureaucratic indifference." The Office was intended to help the "ordinary foot soldiers" to obtain redress for their grievances against higher authorities and the drafters of the Constitution were aware that the creation of the Office, which is seemingly independent of the President, to perform functions which constitutionally should be performed by the President, might be in derogation of the powers of the President as Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces.

            It must be borne in mind that the Office of the Ombudsman was envisioned by the framers of the 1987 Constitution as the "eyes and ears of the people" and "a champion of the citizen." Section 12, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution describes the Ombudsman and his deputies as "protectors of the people." Thus, first and foremost, the Ombudsman and his deputies, including the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military owe their allegiance to the people and ordinary citizens, is clearly not a part of the military. We fail to see how the assumption of jurisdiction by the said office over the investigation of cases involving the PNP would detract from or violate the civilian character of the police force when precisely the Office of the Ombudsman is a civilian office. (Agbay v. Deputy Ombudsman for the Military, G.R. No. 134503, July 2, 1999)

            On the question of jurisdiction, it is beyond dispute that the Ombudsman and the General Court Martial of the AFP have concurring or coordinate jurisdiction over administrative disciplinary cases involving erring military personnel, particularly over violations of the Articles of War that are service-connected. We briefly revisit the nature of court-martial proceedings for context.

            Being sui generis, court-martial proceedings contemplate both the penal and administrative disciplinary nature of military justice. In view of its administrative disciplinary aspect which court-martial proceedings share with the petitioner, both have the concurrent authority to dismiss respondent from the service. "In administrative cases involving the concurrent jurisdiction of two or more disciplining authorities, the body in which the complaint is filed first, and which opts to take cognizance of the case, acquires jurisdiction to the exclusion of other tribunals exercising concurrent jurisdiction."

            """,
            """<b>Impeachment of the Ombudsman</b>
            In accordance with the provisions of Article XI of the Constitution, the Ombudsman may be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, or betrayal of public trust. (Section 8[1], Republic Act No. 6770)

            A Deputy, or the Special Prosecutor, may be removed from office by the President for any of the grounds provided for the removal of the Ombudsman, and after due process. (Section 8[2], Republic Act No. 6770)

            While the removal of the Ombudsman himself is also expressly provided for in the Constitution, which is by impeachment under Section 2 of the same Article, there is, however, no constitutional provision similarly dealing with the removal from office of a Deputy Ombudsman, or a Special Prosecutor, for that matter. By enacting Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770, Congress simply filled a gap in the law without running afoul of any provision in the Constitution or existing statutes. In fact, the Constitution itself, under Section 2, authorizes Congress to provide for the removal of all other public officers, including the Deputy Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor, who are not subject to impeachment.

            Being aware of the constitutional imperative of shielding the Office of the Ombudsman from political influences and the discretionary acts of the executive, Congress laid down two restrictions on the President's exercise of such power of removal over a Deputy Ombudsman, namely: (1) that the removal of the Deputy Ombudsman must be for any of the grounds provided for the removal of the Ombudsman and (2) that there must be observance of due process. Reiterating the grounds for impeachment laid down in Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, paragraph 1 of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 6770 states that the Deputy Ombudsman may be removed from office for the same grounds that the Ombudsman may be removed through impeachment, namely, "culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, or betrayal of public trust." Thus, it cannot be rightly said that giving the President the power to remove a Deputy Ombudsman, or a Special Prosecutor for that matter, would diminish or compromise the constitutional independence of the Office of the Ombudsman. It is, precisely, a measure of protection of the independence of the Ombudsman's Deputies and Special Prosecutor in the discharge of their duties that their removal can only be had on grounds provided by law.

            """<b>Deputy Ombudsman Not Impeachable Official</b>
            A Deputy Ombudsman and a Special Prosecutor are not impeachable officers. However, by providing for their removal from office on the same grounds as removal by impeachment, the legislature could not have intended to redefine constitutional standards of culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, as well as betrayal of public trust, and apply them less stringently. Hence, where betrayal of public trust, for purposes of impeachment, was not intended to cover all kinds of official wrongdoing and plain errors of judgment, this should remain true even for purposes of removing a Deputy Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor from office. Hence, the fact that the grounds for impeachment have been made statutory grounds for the removal by the President of a Deputy Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor cannot diminish the seriousness of their nature nor the acuity of their scope. Betrayal of public trust could not suddenly "overreach" to cover acts that are not vicious or malevolent on the same level as the other grounds for impeachment. (Gonzales v. Office of the President of the Philippines, G.R. No. 196231, September 4, 2012)
            """,
            """<b>The President May Not Remove a Deputy Ombudsman</b>
            Under Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, Congress is empowered to determine the modes of removal from office of all public officers and employees except the President, the Vice- President, the Members of the Supreme Court, the Members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman, who are all impeachable officials.

            The intent of the framers of the Constitution in providing that "all other public officers and employees may be removed from office as provided by law, but not by impeachment" in the second sentence of Section 2, Article XI is to prevent Congress from extending the more stringent rule of "removal only by impeachment" to favored public officers. Understandably so, impeachment is the most difficult and cumbersome mode of removing a public officer from office. It is, by its nature, a sui generis politico-legal process that signals the need for a judicious and careful handling as shown by the process required to initiate the proceeding; the one-year limitation or bar for its initiation; the limited grounds for impeachment; the defined instrumentality given the power to try impeachment cases; and the number of votes required for a finding of guilt. All these argue against the extension of this removal mechanism beyond those mentioned in the Constitution.

            It is in these lights that the second sentence in Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution should be read. Contrary to the implied view of the minority, in no way can this provision be regarded as blanket authority for Congress to provide for any ground of removal it deems fit. While the manner and cause of removal are left to congressional determination, this must still be consistent with constitutional guarantees and principles, namely: the right to procedural and substantive due process; the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure; the principle of separation of powers; and the principle of checks and balances.

            In short, the authority granted by the Constitution to Congress to provide for the manner and cause of removal of all other public officers and employees does not mean that Congress can ignore the basic principles and precepts established by the Constitution.

            While one may argue that the grounds for impeachment under Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 is intended as a measure of protection for the Deputy Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor since these grounds are not intended to cover all kinds of official wrongdoing and plain errors of judgment - this argument seriously overlooks the erosion of the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman that it creates. The mere fact that a statutorily-created sword of Damocles hangs over the Deputy Ombudsman's head, by itself, opens up all the channels for external pressures and influence of officialdom and partisan politics. The fear of external reprisal from the every office he is to check for excesses and abuses defeats the very purpose of granting independence to the Office of the Ombudsman.

            At any rate, even assuming that the OP has disciplinary authority over the Deputy Ombudsman, its decision finding Gonzales guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty and Grave Misconduct constituting betrayal of public trust is patently erroneous. The OP's decision perfectly illustrates why the requirement of impeachment-grounds in Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 cannot be considered, even at a minimum, a measure of protection of the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman.

            In the voting held on January 28, 2014, by a vote of 8-7, the Court resolved to reverse its September 4, 2012 decision in so far as petitioner Gonzales is concerned (G.R. No. 196231). We declared Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 unconstitutional by granting disciplinary jurisdiction to the President over a Deputy Ombudsman, in violation of the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman.

            However, by another vote of 8-7, the Court resolved to maintain the validity of Section 8(2) of Republic Act No. 6770 in so far as Sulit is concerned. The Court did not consider the Office of the Special Prosecutor to be constitutionally within the Office of the Ombudsman and is, hence, not entitled to the independence the latter enjoys under the Constitution.

            WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court resolves to declare Section 8(2) UNCONSTITUTIONAL. (Gonzales v. Office of the President, G.R. No. 196231, January 28, 2014)
